            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I hope thy sobriety will not permit thee to expect the liteness of words so I promise my self thy can did construction of this my bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, to present thee with a sight of a dying work, in its grave clothes, not with its attire on its head, not with its shooes on its feet (because dying) but in its filthy garments, Zach. <hi>3.4.</hi> Among the pots, and as going down to the dust, and therefore the more subject to receive preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, while sent out to travel thorow the Valleys of <hi>Baca,</hi> and the ragged Rocks, before the stones be gathered out, that offendeth the unwary and unarmed Traveller.</p>

               </gap>, that this Work (as the Author) is as one born out of time; how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary this way of edifying thee, is to my Genius; how much I dreaded any such thing, though I had been attended with the greatest encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the present time doth not allow me, how much beside my intention, when first I had occasion to think on these things, and how many distractions I have had pulling me away from waiting on my Master, either when go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jairus</hi> his House, to revive the Child, or when going to <hi>Judea,</hi> to raise <hi>Lazarus,</hi> or when disputing the Case with his unbelieving Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or when pleading with <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God, for his return to revive his People; If (I say) I should tell thee what of this kind I have met with to discourage me, you would rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that with <hi>Agar,</hi> I have not thrown away this Child; Then censure me for not having that dexterity, in clothing of it with these come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ornaments, that such as come on the Stage, and have to do with such a conceited, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish Generation, finde necessary.

The Fourth, in continuance, or custome thereof, wherein, whosoever is once buried, (saith this <hi>Ancient Father</hi>) He is hardly raised to Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without a great Miracle of God, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears on his own part. Where you may see. He doth more than I do, in making use of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by perufing what I have said, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the same with his Paraphraze on the Text. If it be said, that I refer it to the work of God in general, thou may answer thy self, by a sober making use of that phylosophical maxim, <hi>Quod convenit uni tali convenit omni tali.</hi> And, if this Rule be not transgressed, then I hope thou wilt forbear to censure, and look on thy self, as particularly concerned in this thing. I might instance to you several <hi>Modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> that do say, by <hi>Lazarus</hi> is holden forth the poor, low, and abject condition of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:108025:5"/> of God: These have passed thorow thy hands without thy censure, (for ought I know) and I shall hope thou wilt not make a new Law for condemning of that in me, that hath been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and approved in others.</p>
            <p>But expecting the best of thee, (or at least) being resolved to bear the worst thou can say of me, or of this interprise (till God make thee of a better mind, by reviving his work) I shall make bold to give thee some fore-tast of the subject matter of this following Discourse.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> Thou hast here presented to thee, a discovery of the wonderful wisdome of God, in his Providence, about his friends; where you may see a work happily begun, piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y marred in the Progress, and yet crowned with loving kindness in the end; And that, notwithstanding of all the mistakes of Persons concerned about it, as you may clearly see, in your considering what is said, as to <hi>Jairus</hi> his Child. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may see the matchless love of a Redeemer, that cannot forget a sick, dead, and stinking <hi>Lazarus,</hi> nor be terrified from going down to <hi>Judea,</hi> to see, and raise him; notwithstanding of his Disciples dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the contrary, and his own hazard: To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with what is commendable, or discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in the Saints carriage at such a time, and when call'd to such trials, and to wait on
<pb facs="tcp:108025:5"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> in the performance of such acts of love toward his dead friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have the Resurrection of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> together with a gracious disappointment of the Disciples fears of dying, upon their going down to <hi>Judea,</hi> and of all their hopes, for they had no hope for the most part, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> should be raised again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You have all this generally summed up in my last work, together with that, wherein the Saints exercise doth principally consist, <hi>viz.</hi> their serious pleading with God for a reviving, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whereof is such, as my present Work would permit me to give; if it be wanting in any thing, know, I was necessitated (for thy sake) to abrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it, least this Work should be too burdensome to thee, which of its own nature is heavy, and (being dead) cannot but burden thee the more. This is a brief account of the subject matter. For my curt stile, or what else of this nature thou may quarrel with, know, I studied brevity, and ever judged matter better than words, and that it's needless to speak that by many words, which may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by few: <hi>Frustra sit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora:</hi> And I have the adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en and handled, and what you have in some measure tasted of. All I desire is to inform thy judgment about the present case
<pb facs="tcp:108025:6"/> of thy soul, &amp; of Christs great concerns, to affect thy heart, to rectifie thy mistakes, and to encourage thee to put too thy shoulder, for rolling away the Stone, that our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> may rise again; and to help thee to plead for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving from God, that he may be glorified, his house built up in troublesome times, and all his Saints made to shout for joy.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three things that seem too wonderful for us, The first is, <hi>That a work should die in Christ's hand,</hi> who is the Prince of life, all whose Saints are lively, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in his hand, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.3. The second thing that seems too wonderful for us, is, <hi>That death that does fall on Christ's work; cannot, by its strong bonds, detain the work, when Christ hath a mind to revive it,</hi> then the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108025:7"/> Earth shall no more cover his slain, his dead shall live and must arise, The faith of which makes his People sing in the dust.</p>
            <p>The third thing that seems too wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us, is, <hi>That all these deaths by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment hasten towards the reviving of his People:</hi> when he kills, reviving is within two days march to his People, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>After two days he will revive us again, and we shall live in his sight.</hi> All these three you may see in this instance, that my Text pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents you with.</p>
            <p>I shall, before I enter upon the words, premise these three things. First, <hi>While it's going very well with one Patient under cure, it may be going very sad, with another.</hi> The poor Woman being cured, she is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed in peace, and while he is speaking his word of dismission and confirmation to her; the news came that one of Christ's Patients is dead, his ways are various and past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, not to be disputed, but adored; <hi>Magnifie the work that Men see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second thing I would premise is this, That <hi>the Saints eminent enjoyments are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily followed with eminent Tentations Iairus</hi> is admitted to Christ's company, sees what he had done, and heares what gracious words he had spoken to this poor Woman,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108025:7"/> and immediately while Christ spake, and he heard, <hi>Certain came, that tell him the Child is dead.</hi> It were good to be sober under the receipt of mercy, and in a calm Day to look out for a storm.</p>
            <p>A third thing I would premise is this, <hi>That what is here written, it is written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. and these are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples unto us, so that, if in this Discourse, I shall be found to draw it as far as I can without doing violence to it, I exspect your pardon, that are willing to accept of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: As for others that cast him and his words, especially the word of the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, as he, so will I, suffer them, till the harvest, seeing <hi>the Lord is at hand.</hi> But <hi>let him that hath an ear hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit saith unto the Churches,</hi> and improve this to profit withall. So I come to the words <hi>themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which you have, first, the sad <hi>news of the Child's death,</hi> the Child is dead. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have a <hi>sharp challenge,</hi> Why troublest thou the Master any further?</p>
            <p>For the first, In it consider these three: <hi>First, the time when this news came,</hi> it was while <hi>Jesus</hi> was speaking, sad <hi>news in the midst of a sweet Sermon is both sudden, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108025:8"/> and astonishing.</hi> You may be richly edified by his Grace, and instantly winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his providence, and yet the one tends as really to thy future advantage, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seems for the present to be sweet and pleasant to thee.</p>
            <p>The second thing you have here is the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that bring the news,</hi> certain that came from <hi>Iairus</hi> his own house that undoubtedly knew the thing very well, there is no place left for disputing, or doubting the truth of the thing, besides that natural propensity in us, to close with sad news, and our fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experiences, that tells us that such reports seldom fail. Our Lord sees it fit to order his People's Trials so, as they may be of great weight in themselves, and of great certainty unto those that are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the <hi>Message it self,</hi> the Child is dead, O how killing! and yet it does not wound: what a violent storm, and yet it settles, not shakes the godly Man's faith; It was the better for this dead Child, that the Father had two lives, not only that Natural Life, but also that Spiritual Life whereby he was kept close to his duty, and unto Christ in the midst of his tentation. Thus much for clearing to you the first part of the words,</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:108025:8"/>
            <p>The second thing considerable in them, <hi>is the challenge,</hi> which in their deep sorrow and discouragement, upon what they had seen, they give to <hi>Iairus, Why trouble you the Master any further?</hi> Where, first, you may see <hi>their reverence</hi> and <hi>respect,</hi> they call him <hi>Master. Secondly,</hi> You have their <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, viz.</hi> in that they thought that it was troublesome to <hi>Christ</hi> to be imploy'd about his work. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this was not only their <hi>thoughts now under the tentation,</hi> but that it had been their thoughts of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness all along, that <hi>Iairus</hi> would trouble himself, and the Master too, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and meerly out of a humour, not in any rational way: for the Child is dying, when he goes to Christ, and now is dead, after he has put him to much trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. Thus much for clearing the second and last part of the words.</p>
            <p>I shall only speak unto these three points of Doctrine. The first point is this, That a work happily begun and countenanced by Christ very much, may meet with many sad things, and fall under a cloud, before it come to a close.</p>
            <p>The second Doctrine is this, That the Trials that attends Christ's work, makes many heart discoveries.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:108025:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That all the deaths and tryals that befalls Christ's undertaking, are for his glory, or thus, glory grows out of them; they must pay this rent to him that is the Soveraign disposer of them.</p>
            <p>I return to speak unto the first point of Doctrine. There is a happy begining here, as you may see from <hi>Vers.</hi> 22, 23, 24. and yet here the Child not only grows worse, but dies, <hi>the Child is dead:</hi> there is the cloud that passes over the concerns of Christ in this undertaking of his. The like you may see in many of our Masters undertakings, whether it relate to his publick work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Church or Nation in the general, or else to a particular work of grace, on particular Souls. For the first, you know that his delivering his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had a good begining, yet came under many clouds, ere it came to a close.</p>
            <p>The Lord at first <hi>appears</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> he <hi>speaks to him,</hi> he tells him <hi>he had seen the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of his People,</hi> and that he would <hi>come down,</hi> and save them, he sends <hi>him to treat with Pharaoh</hi> about this thing, he convinces many of the Enemies, that the Land suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their cruelty used to the People of God, and that this was the finger of God. This was a good begining, and yet the work
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108025:9"/> grows worse, their bondage becomes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, than before; and truly it is ordinary that it is darkest before Day-break, and the shadows flee away. A second instance to prove this, is that of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> The Lord stirs up Authority to give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to those that had any respect to the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And first, The <hi>King gives Commandment to them to go and build.</hi> Secondly, <hi>He provides them what things necessary for advancing of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>He commands all his Subjects to advance the building, by contributing each to it, according to their capacities.</hi> Fourthly, The poor Heathen People, they willingly give in their help and concurrence; There's a good begining, yet you see within a little while, the haters of <hi>Zion</hi> mis-represents the work, calls the City a <hi>rebellious</hi> City, and so <hi>obtain an Order to cause them to desist from the work;</hi> This interruption was a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Cloud, that passed over the concerns of God at that time. And what shall I speak of Christ himself, they highly esteem him, they wonder at what he does, they will make him a King, and anon they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him. And as it fared with the green Tree, so it fares with the dry. As to his particular work in souls, how is it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108025:10"/> like the Disciples going to Sea; it is very calm at the begining, <hi>for our Lord will not let some go to War in the first Year of their Marriage,</hi> but when they are going on, and making progress, the Winds rise, the Ship fills with Seas, and then they exspect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death. And this Note, That such as are brought in to Him by his still Voice of the Gospel, and are drawn to him by his Cords of Love, do usually meet with some remarkable humbling dispensation, after that the Work is happily begun in them.</p>
            <p>In Prosecution of this Point, I shall speak unto these <hi>Three</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I shall shew you what good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings there may be at first undertaking of a work, or at our first putting a work in Christ's hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew you that it may grow worse with this work, after all <hi>these good beginings:</hi> It may grow worse than ever it was before, <hi>The Child is dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why is it that our Lord orders his concerns thus, that after they have had a good beginning, yet they grow worse, and die.</p>
            <p>For the first of these, What is that good begining, that a work may have in a Church
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108025:10"/> or Nation? For answer unto this, I say, <hi>First,</hi> It's a good begining when Persons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about this work, brings the work to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Door; It's said they brought all their sick and diseased unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and truly the Disease is more than half cured, when it's laid at <hi>Christ</hi>'s Feet, <hi>Rise, take up thy Bed and walk;</hi> may be <hi>Christ</hi>'s next word to such a soul; It were good, if so it were with us: If we could trust him with his work in our souls, he would direct our thoughts, and in due time he would bring it to pass.</p>
            <p>A second excellent thing, that is, <hi>a good begining,</hi> is this, when a Soul upon seeking in to <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Lord does finde him, <hi>He that findes me, findes life▪ and obtains favour of the Lord. Iairus</hi> findes <hi>Christ,</hi> when seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. It is that which galls a Cross, and breaks the Heart, when the Soul, under the perswasion, that <hi>help only</hi> is to be had in Him, <hi>cannot finde him,</hi> Job 23.3. <hi>O that I knew where to finde him,</hi> Vers. 8, 9. <hi>Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward but I cannot perceive him. On the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:</hi> So <hi>Song</hi> 5.6. <hi>I sought him, but I found him not; I called for him, but he made me no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi> But, O! how sweet is it when the Soul seeks him, and findes him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.42.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108025:11"/> and when it findes him, it will not let him go, till it bring him unto its Mothers house. <hi>Song</hi> 3.4. So <hi>Iairus</hi> here seeks him, and findes him.</p>
            <p>A third excellent begining, is this, when the Soul is earnest in its addresses to him, that is, much in intreaties, as <hi>Iairus</hi> was here, <hi>Vers.</hi> 23. and as that Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.47. <hi>He besought him to come down</hi> very earnestly, as you may see, by doubling his request, <hi>Vers.</hi> 49. Our Lord never opens the Mouth to ask, and to ask earnestly, but he has an open heart to give in supplies; As <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eking</hi> is hopeful in it self, so when attended with <hi>ardency</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> its <hi>next neighbour</hi> to <hi>find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when he is asked for of the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> then he accomplishes his promises.</p>
            <p>A fourth excellent begining that is here, and it's very hopeful, is this Man's humility, it's said, <hi>He fell at his Feet,</hi> humility is the first step to exaltation, humble your selves under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt you in due time: There is a two-fold capacity in this excellent grace, in order to the obtaining of mercies. <hi>First,</hi> It hides from storms, by keeping the Christian with a low Sail, like the lower shrubs, they don't meet with such a Wind as the tall Cedar. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's that which has the promise,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108025:11"/> he saves all the meek of the Earth, the meek he teaches his judgements, the meek he teaches his way; <hi>but pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fifth excellent begining is this, There is <hi>faith in the case,</hi> if thou wilt but touch her, she shall be made whole, she shall live; It's sad that that faith that should be first at work in our imploying of <hi>Christ</hi> comes last: we exercise not faith for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of strength to prevail with <hi>Christ,</hi> when we are very ready, at least for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, to bring in faith in the close, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the pardon of things both omitted and committed against the Lord. Note, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever faith begins and puts work in Christ's hand, loving-kindness heals weaknesses, and crowns all with blessedness.</p>
            <p>A sixth excellent begining, that you have here, is this, <hi>Christ welcomes Iairus, and willingly and readily undertakes the work.</hi> None more welcome to Christ, than the Man that comes to imploy him about his work; and there is nothing he more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undertakes, then work that belongs to his Office as Mediator; and there is no fear when Christ welcomes you, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes all your works in you, and for you; come to him at mid-night, he is the friend
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108025:12"/> at mid-night, that will open to you, and supply your wants.</p>
            <p>A seventh excellent begining here, is this, That <hi>Christ gives Iairus a promise that he will cure the Child;</hi> Not that the Childe shall not grow worse, or die, but that die it, or not, he will cure it: <hi>Christ</hi>'s promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses always leave a latitude for his Power and Wisdom, to carry out the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, as it seems most conducing to his Holy end and purpose.</p>
            <p>An eighth excellent begining that is here is this, That <hi>Jesus Christ presently goes about it,</hi> he is on his way to <hi>Jairus</hi> his house, and truly it's a brave begining, when <hi>Christ</hi> is on his way to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and making haste, so that all the Disciples are made to cast their Garments, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.) and strows them in the way before their triumphing <hi>King,</hi> Buyers and Sellers, may look for, turned over Tables, and turning out at Doors, when Christ's haste makes Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cast their Cloaths; It's lovely to see <hi>Christ</hi> skipping over the Mountains like a Hinde, and like a Roe.</p>
            <p>A ninth excellent begining here, is this, <hi>He gives a fresh proof of his Power and Virtue,</hi> in Curing the Woman with her Bloody Issue; This <hi>Jairus</hi> sees, for confirming of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108025:12"/> his faith, and truly it's a great ground of incouragement to thee, when thou sees as bad, as sick, and as hopeless sinners, as thou art, Cured by one touch of the Hem of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Garment.</p>
            <p>A tenth and last excellent begining, is this, That <hi>Jairus is kept at his duty, till his mercy comes;</hi> he never parts with <hi>Christ,</hi> till he performed the promise, nor does he challenge him for preferring of others, that accidentally met with him in the way; It's our safety to adhere to our duty, and when his People are tender and conscientious in doing their part, then <hi>Christ</hi> shall be found faithful in doing his, in his time, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the first thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is the blessed begining that <hi>Jairus</hi> met with, when he came to <hi>Christ</hi> about his Daughter.</p>
            <p>I come to the second thing propounded, to be spoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> that notwithstanding of all these excellent beginings, the Childe grows worse, and dies; Where <hi>First,</hi> take notice of this, that now <hi>Christ</hi> seems <hi>to break this bruised Reed, by doubling his burthen: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was bowed down, as low as he could stoop,</hi> even to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Feet, under the weight of a sick Childe; now he has a hopeless-like
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108025:13"/> burthen of a dead Child. The Child is dead. And truly sometimes our Lord, when he intends to take off thy present bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that thou casts over on him, he layes on thee another that is more pressing down, and sinking, that he may have the more mercy on thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Now it seems the Poor Man's <hi>expectation is frustrated, he expected news of a Cure wrought by Christ,</hi> but now in the midst of his expectation, the Childe dies, and this is very sad, when the expectation of the poor Supplicant fails him, but it shall not be for ever; If it be of God, that saves the upright in heart, and grounded on a promise, as this is here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Now it would seem, that, <hi>His great beseeching of Christ is in vain, as the People of the House judged,</hi> and it's a sad Death to the People of God, when all their Prayers seem to be slighted, and when providence gives a check to them all, what might some now say? but as in the 22. <hi>Psal. He trusted in God that he would deliver him;</hi> Let him do it now, seeing he delighted in him. Delays are not Denials, the Childe may die, and to thy sense all thy Prayers may die with it, but you shall finde your mistake in the close.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:108025:13"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon the growing worse of of the work, and the Child's death, this is very sad, that now <hi>Christ is not so good as his word,</hi> he promised to cure the Childe, and now she is dead, what is now come of the promise, this providence seemeth to destroy it; Note this, many sad trials may fall out betwixt the giving of a promise, and the performance thereof: <hi>Isaac</hi> must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, before the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> be as the Sand of the Sea-shore for multitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There seems to be partiality▪ and unequal dealing in the case; In that one that is in no such hazard, and picks him up by the way side, without intreaties, or any such wrestlings, as he had about his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, should be cured instantly, and in the mean time his daughter dies. Grace may act in a way of soveraignty to some, and yet in the ordinary way of duty to others, they must be first whom he will have first, though Christ cure one that makes not half of the busling that thou makes; nor is not in such a dangerous case; yet you must not offend, but wait upon him, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that he may do with his own what he pleaseth, and improving his mercy to others, for strengthning thy faith about thy own cross, and thy deliverance out of it.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:108025:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That now <hi>there is no probable ground of a delivery,</hi> the Childe is dead, nothing now can be done, all probable ways disappear. This Death hides the promise, hides Christ, hides the duty, and hides the former gracious works that Christ had done, and fills all the House with darkness, crying and confusion, only <hi>Jairus</hi> himself a Person most concerned, hath the least bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of his hopeless case, because in his duty, and with Christ, and truly the more improbable things appear to be, we should adhere to Christ the more, and hold out peace, till we hear what Christ will say; and say the same thing with him, he will work next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This is very sad that all the friends next to the work are under grievous mistakes, being thus clouded with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation; they mistake, even then when Christ was near<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st them, when their duty was most call'd for from their hand, and when the work was neerest the recovery. In violent Fevers oft-times Persons rave most when neerest to a cool, so is it often with the People of God, they sometimes never rave, and speaks more idly, than when their mercy is within sight of them. I shall name these few mistakes, that these certain Persons were guilty of.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They were guilty of this mistake, in that they looked on all <hi>Jairus</hi> Prayers, and Faith, that he had exercised in imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, to be troublesome to Christ, you have been <hi>troubling all this time,</hi> as the words import, for why should they say, <hi>Trouble Him no further,</hi> if they had not thought it a trouble to <hi>Christ</hi> to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as he was, truly we trouble Him by slighting Him, but never by praying to him, or believing in Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They mistake in this, in that they judge the cause hopeless and helpless, <hi>The Childe is dead,</hi> there is no help, there is no hope, but dead it must be, there is no hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against hope here, this dispensation makes them all to stagger, they consider the death that is on the Childe, but does not consider who has undertaken the Cure, nor his promise about it, and therefore they thus mistake and faint.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> mistake is this, That they judg that Christ can do nothing now, the Child being dead, if there had been any life, he might have preserved it, but life being gone, he cannot recall it, this seems to be their very sentiments upon the whole; and this is a very great mistake, for most of our Lord's work is among the dead, he can
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108025:15"/> as easily revive them, as he did create them: one word does both; oft-times he by death brings to life; by breaking down, builds up; and by wounding, he cures; so that it's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in vain nor irrational, as this challenge imports, to imploy Christ about <hi>a dead cause,</hi> a dead heart, or a dead Childe. The reviving of such, God works oft-times with men. Thus much for the second thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> the growing worse of the case and cause, now undertaken by our Lord.</p>
            <p>I come in the third place to the reasons; why our Lord suffers a death to fall on his own concerns, and things to grow worse upon his undertaking of them, and that after so good appearances at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The first Reason why our Lord suffers things to die, and grow worse, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have had an excellent begining, is, that he may give them a proof of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power, when all their wisdom and power is gone, so that they know not what to do, for lack of wisdom; and they cannot do what they know, for lack of power and strength: this <hi>Job</hi> acknowledges, <hi>Job</hi> 12.13. <hi>With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</hi> Oft-times
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108025:15"/> the People of God are discouraged when they see both wisdom and power upon the other side, yet our Lord by some such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience like this that is in my Text, makes them see that there is wisdom and power both on their side, <hi>Isa.</hi> 31.2. <hi>Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, he will rise against the house of evil doers,</hi> he will shew them that he is so wise, that he knows how to advance his work by all the stops and deaths that it meets with, and how to inrich his People by impoverishing them, how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them by all their imprisonments, and how to give them meat out of their eaters; and he will give them a proof of his power in supporting them, when their crosses are sincking and discouraging; yea, sometimes our Lord smiles at the tryal of the innocent when it's most violent, because thereby an occasion is offered him, to make known his Wisdom and Power, in supporting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering of his People, and bringing them at last to a wealthy place: This is the first Reason.</p>
            <p>The second Reason of the Point is this, when our Lord has happily begun his work in a Nation, City, or particular Soul, he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it to grow worse, and to die in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to check and reprove Persons that are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108025:16"/> imployed, and concerned about that work. Now there are these five things that need a rebuke in Persons concerned in Christ's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. The <hi>First</hi> is this, when his work prospers, and when he grants his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abundance of encouragement, then his <hi>People, they begin to exalt themselves,</hi> they forget the Apostle's Exhortation, <hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi> and so exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in <hi>Baal,</hi> they dye, this brings a death upon them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.1. It's a very omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing to the Church of God, when the Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> walk with out-stretched Neck, and play the wanton, till they provoke the Lord to kill them with thirst: <hi>I will slay her with thirst, she shall no more come at her Idols, Hos.</hi> 2. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had waxen proud and wanton against the Lord: So <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.61. They grow proud of external Ordinances, they look more to the Ark, than the God of the Ark: They glory in the Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and forget the God of it; Well, what does our Lord in this case? To check their Pride and Wantonness, He delivered His Strength into Captivity, and His Glory to the Enemies Hand. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on His Work thus to check His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's carelessnesse and sloathfulnesse about
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108025:16"/> the work, when they come first to imploy Christ, they use to intreat him greatly, and then our Lord gives them encouragement, but so soon as they get a little of this <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> this sleeping drink, they fall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careless, and indifferent, and laye by the work: whereupon the Lord suffers a death to fall upon his <hi>People, and sends them the dreadful</hi> alaraming newes, <hi>The Ark of God is taken, the Glory is departed from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi> That by this death on his own work he may revive thy Prayers, increase thy tears, and double thy actings of faith that have been dead with thee this long time: Our Lord loves not to see Ministers sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Professors doting, when he is risen up to the prey; And therefore, though he had given us never so promising beginings, he will put a stop to his work, till he make thee that art the Minister or Professor, rise up and shine in thy duty, when he is risen up, and is shining in his Sanctuary, <hi>Hos,</hi> 5.15. <hi>In their affliction they will seek me early. Thirdly,</hi> It is to check their self-seeking, oft-times when we meet with encouragement in his way, we become selfish, and too much mind our own things, this provokes him to send a death on them, some hug their Children till they kill them, some are so
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108025:17"/> taken up with their own things, that they leave Christ alone, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>last.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is it that our Lord layes a death on that thing that thou loves more, seeks more, delights in more than thou does in him. It's ominous to his Work and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when Persons intrusted with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do mind their own things. If you do, our Master will check this in you, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a death on the work, and on all your interest also, that you minded more than the work, which should have been your principal interest. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To check our unbelief, oft-times we commit our work to him by faith, but we do not exercise this faith unto a patient waiting for the Lord, they that believe make not haste, that is, that keep faith in exercise about the work, but truly however there be some acts of faith put forth upon our first imploying of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the encouragement that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes upon us, yet we don't keep up this excellent exercise of faith, and thereupon we, and the Childe, and all dies; O that we could mind these two words, <hi>viz.</hi> his first word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>Come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. His last word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>Abide in me.</hi> When we turn off from him, he turns out death, with a Commission to seize on all
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108025:17"/> our glory, as a sufficient check to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief that causes us thus to depart from him. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He suffers a death on his work to check the carnality and earthly mindedness that may be found amongst Professors, which is the great cause of this untender walking and backsliding, that makes the Name of God to be blasphemed among the Heathen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. So 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. Thou hast given occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Enemies of God to blaspheme; and to say of the Professors of this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Loe, such a People are become like unto us. Now to vindicate his own name thus reproached and blasphemed, he causes a death to seize his work, and so sanctifies his Name in the sight of all the Nations, that are astonished at this; not knowing the thoughts of the Lord in all this. Thus much for the second Reason of the Point.</p>
            <p>The Third Reason is this, That by these deaths on his own work, he may let them see how much he is provoked, when to correct and chastise them, he will give up his glory unto captivity: Let the Childe die, and foolish men do what they can to disswade the honest waiter on <hi>Christ</hi> from having any more to do with him; <hi>Trouble him no more, for all is in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:108025:18"/>
            <p>The Fourth Reason is this, Thereby our Lord raises the worth and esteem of his mercies in the hearts of his People; now he is gone, Did not our hearts burn within us, <hi>while he talked with us by the way;</hi> they had but low thoughts of him while present, but so soon as he is gone, they begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their sense of the mercy they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injoyed, but now they are deprived of it. We usually never know the worth of a thing till it be dead, and then we would scratch them out of the Grave wherein they are buried, providing we might have them.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Reason, why our Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to permit a death to befall his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, is to try his Peoples respect to their duty, and to try whether they will adhere to it, even then when in the way of it they meet both with sad dispensations and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments: you may hear this godly Man's practise speaking thus, when they tell him the Childe is dead; well, says he, be it so, Christ has promised to cure him, he has admitted me to wait on him; I have come thus far with him, and found a dead Childe, I will stay with him till I finde a living, for although there be a dead Child in the providence, yet there is a living
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108025:18"/> Childe in the promise, I will hold that fast, as it's my duty, I say, it's promising then, when a Christian is close and tender in his duty, and our Lord loves this very much.</p>
            <p>The Sixth and last Reason, is to make us the more tender of these things, when he revives them again; you see, after they have made a good progress, and <hi>Christ</hi> hath given great ground of hope, death may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake them: <hi>The Childe dies.</hi> It's a desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable promise you have, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.10. <hi>They shall not glory any more, because of the Holy Mountain;</hi> We must neither undervalue, nor over-value his external concerns; true tenderness keeps off both extreams: And, if by under-valuing or over-valuing, you have provoked God, to permit deadning dispensations, to befall the Church of God, be sure now to be more tender in improving Gospel-ordinances, and a Gospel-Ministery than ever you have been.</p>
            <p>I come now to the use of this point: If it be so, that a work undertaken by <hi>Christ,</hi> countenanced and owned by him, may come under a death; Then you need not think strange, if any such thing happen unto you, in your progress to Heaven, after you have been revived, and inlightned, and got the work in <hi>Christ</hi>'s hand, there may a death
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108025:19"/> pass upon you: This is no strange tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what is common to men. Now, here I shall a little lay before you the hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of your case, even then when it's helpless, as to you.</p>
            <p>As to the hopefulness of our condition, though it's worse with us now, than it hath been: Consider, <hi>First,</hi> That it's hopeful, though for the present helpless, because we have brought it unto him, and put the work in his hand; Nay more, he hath taken it out of all our hands, as he did in the case in my Text; Did you not finde, that when you committed your way to the Lord, that then he brought it to pass?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Was not this a hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to see a People coming out of the fire, and from the Plague trembling, and melted down at Christ's Feet, then you spake trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and he exalted you, by sending forth from these flames, the cooling Waters of the Sanctuary, that run plentifully towards you, when the Gospel had a free passage, by the Indulgence of the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for several Years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There was this hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spirit of Grace and Supplication, poured out upon Ministers, and Professors, that made them beseech him greatly, then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108025:19"/> every place you sought him in, had this to testifie in your behalf, that you were there, and <hi>did greatly beseech him;</hi> O what a brave ground of confidence is this in your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, that sayes, <hi>Ask what you will, and it shall be given to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There was this hopeful begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That upon your seeking of him, you did really finde him; sometimes, it's true, you have been put to a little more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and pains, before you found him; but, is there none in all the Church that can say, <hi>I both sought, and found him not;</hi> And, I went a little further, <hi>and I found him whom my Soul loves:</hi> believe me, it's a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful begining, when you finde the Physician, and that giving you proofs, both of his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and willingness to do your business for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There was this notable begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> sweetly welcom'd thee upon thy coming to him, and finding of him: Hath not Christ welcomed you by his great offers he hath made to you? He has offered you grace and glory at first word, and by his great promises for the future, I will never, never▪ never leave you, nor forsake you: Hath not he welcomed you, when he hath set you down before
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108025:20"/> him? and he hath stood so to speak, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you: No sooner have you come in to the Banquet of Wine, but our Lord hath got up, and served you with the finest of the Wheat, and with Honey from the Rock, thy fill. And is not this a good begining, and a Door of Hope, for the Travellers to <hi>Zion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Was not faith in exercise, that if he would come and touch the Childe, it should live; and truly, it's an excellent begining, when faith hath the first word, does the first work, and turns back, and tells the humble Supplicant, that <hi>Mercy shall be built up for ever; Psal.</hi> 89.4. <hi>I had fainted, or I had done worse, if I had not believed.</hi> It's well with the People of God, when they have faith, to set against all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and discouragements, that are in their way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and lastly, Is not this a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable begining, that you have in some measure been kept at your duty, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all the growing difficulties and discouragements in your day, ye have not wickedly departed from his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor refused the thing that pleaseth him, whether it be his pleasure that you should bear his Cross, or do him such, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108025:20"/> so much service; Now, all these, and many more, doe witness how mercifully our Lord begins with you again, after he had purged you by the <hi>Pestilence, Fire,</hi> and <hi>Sword;</hi> But,</p>
            <p>What do I here? <hi>The Childe is dead,</hi> it's worse with us than it was before: The Master hath been too long a coming, we must not any more make mention of the Lord, or of the Words of his Holiness; Let all go, as <hi>Agar</hi> to the Wilderness; with the small allowance allotted for them, and let them die there: Why, what is the matter? <hi>The Child is dead, the work is dead, and all is dead with it:</hi> And, here I would call you seriously to consider the cause of this, and mourn for it before the Lord, in so far as it's a culpable cause, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it in so far as Soveraignty is to be seen in it; Have Ministers fallen dead, do they stagger, and grope as at Noon-day, are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances dead, and is the Comforter that relieves the Soul far away from them, are Providences, Mercies, Crosses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all dead; Why, Is there not a Cause?</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> Are not all of us found out of the dust, we have grown proud, and kicked at <hi>GOD</hi>'s Ordinances and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: We have forgot that the Root bears
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108025:21"/> us, but not we it, and have said, <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more unto thee,</hi> Jer. 2.31. Now when a People thus provokes him, what can be done with them, but to bring them low by one sad death on them or another, that he may exalt them again in due time; Let a People shake off Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, they thereby break the precious Box, wherein all the rest of the Graces are kept; break this, and fall proud, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly all the rest of your graces vanish unto smoke. Therefore my advice to you, is that which you have, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I come up suddenly, and in a moment, to consume you: Therefore put away your Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that I may know what to do unto you.</hi> No Man can tell what can be done with a proud People, except it be to destroy them; yea more, they can desire nothing from God, but what is destructive to them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because of the curse, or because of their abuse of the same; Therefore be not proud least your bonds be made strong, least he cause darkness, and you stumble upon the high Mountains, when its black darkness, as the shadow of death, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is there not a death on that concernedness of Spirit, and seriousness that was amongst the Lord's People at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108025:21"/> where is that earnestness in your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of duties; who amongst us does greatly intreat our Lord to go down, and heal our sick, or revive our dead? Are there not certain, that proceed from our hearts every day, and tells us, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions are dead, that our conscience is almost dead, that the Power of Godliness is almost dead, if not altogether, and which is worst of all, do press us to give over duty, as a thing that is troublesome to the Master; and alas, it's because it's trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to us, and to this luke-warm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different temper, that cannot endure pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence in the ways of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> At our begining, we sought and found him, but now what hath befallen us; May we not call out with <hi>Elisha,</hi> where is the Lord God of <hi>Elijah:</hi> And with <hi>Job,</hi> O that we knew where to finde him, or is it not worse; The Lord hath hid himself, and we are not troubled, our hearts doe not break, when we hear dead Ordinances, dead Providences, dead Hearts, dumb and silent Rods, calling thus, <hi>He hath forsaken his House, and made every one of us walk like blind Men, because of our iniquity,</hi> Zeph. 1.17. O that at length we could lay this to heart!</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> At the begining he sweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd us, he spoke to us, and gave us promise, and told us that he was with us, while we were with him, but now the case is grown worse; we speak, but he makes us no answer, or then its a terrible answer we meet with: And which is worst of all, we are become so dead, that we either care not for his answering of us, or fear it not when it is by terrible things in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Did we not enter on our duty, with some measure of faith, that if he would but put to his hand to the <hi>wound,</hi> it should be healed, but ah, what do I hear? <hi>Trouble Him no more.</hi> This tells us that faith is gone, and that love is grown cold, is not faith scarce to be found, and hath not the love of many waxed cold? And, if so, Is it not worse with us, than it was? and shall we not dread and fear what may be the end thereof? Surely at best, such shall not be witnesses to his immediate act in reviving of the Childe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and Lastly, The Day hath been when the People of God consulted their duty, and did keep close to it, as <hi>Jairus</hi> did, not regarding tentations and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements; but now have we not separated
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:108025:23"/> our hearts from him, and when we call for Ordinances, do we seek him with the heart? What should all these things do unto us, if we had them, seeing we fear not God, and are so careless of our duty.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Use is this, To intreat you to take courage, mind the days of old, and how sweetly <hi>Christ</hi> welcomed you, when you came to him, mind his promise, there is life in it for a dead work; Remember he is on his way, wait for him, and what-ever be the tentation slight it, and keep close by <hi>Christ,</hi> till you see the end of the Lord in all this.</p>
            <p>The last thing I shall recommend to you in the behalf of his dying work, shall be to call you to do what you can to strengthen what remains, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. and to <hi>revive what is dead;</hi> Now there are these <hi>Six</hi> things, I would plead for at your hand: The <hi>First</hi> is, Attend it with a mournful eye, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. <hi>Mourn for the solemn Assemblies:</hi> If <hi>David</hi> did weep after the Beir of <hi>Abner,</hi> and if <hi>Phinea</hi>'s Wife mourned for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting glory, when it was vail'd over, and small; how much more should we weep for the departing of the glory of the second House, that is far more glorious; Let us write down <hi>Ichabod</hi> upon all our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us attend it with a lively faith, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> he will revive it again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.7. <hi>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me,</hi> Hab. 3. <hi>Revive thy work in the midst of the years,</hi> Psal. 102.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Love it, though in the Grave, and stincking there. O for love to it! This would constrain you (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.) to bear, indure, and do all things; Love thinks it can never do enough for <hi>Christ,</hi> and for his interests.</p>

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Labour to keep them alive in the

                  </gap>w the Lord shall do exploits,</hi> Dan. 11. And this is a noble exploit, when you can preserve <hi>Christ</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and the interest of holiness, alive, even then when all the outward concerns of both are dead; <hi>Holiness becomes thy House, O Lord, for ever, Psal.</hi> 93 <hi>last▪</hi> for ever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deaths and dangers: This does admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably beautifie the House of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Labour for a Christian Spirit, a Spirit of Zeal, not tainted with the fear of Men, nor satisfied with any thing that is only of private concernment, a shrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low Spirit very much dishonours so great a Leader and Commander as Christ hath been unto us.</p>
            <p>And to shut up this, There is <hi>(First)</hi> this that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y encourage you to it, that <hi>Christ</hi> is most willing to engage an Advocate to plead the Cause, and vindicate the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and integrity of such a People, that are thus imployed about his dying work: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour him he will honour:</hi> we should lay honour, and all at the stake, for honouring of him; and then expect the performance of that promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.6. <hi>He shall bring forth thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108025:25"/> and thy judgment as the Noon-Day,</hi> So <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What ever cost or charges you are put to about this work, it makes all for your selves, and your best interest, <hi>Isai.</hi> 32.8. <hi>The liberal man deviseth liberal things, and by liberal things he stands. David</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages to build God a House: Nay, says the Lord, <hi>I will build thee an House,</hi> he will render double unto thee thy loss, for <hi>Christ</hi> shall be gain, and thy gain and purchase thou makes in denying of <hi>Christ</hi> shall be loss, <hi>he that saveth his life shall lose it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If thou wilt thus concern thy s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thou shalt be of all the most usefull and blessed Christian, and a blessing to others in thy Generation: <hi>The blessing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>you shall rejoyce in the Lord,</hi> Hab. 3.18. Thus much for the first thing propounded unto you.</p>
            <p>The second thing that I observe here, is the effect, that this death produceth on the Friends of <hi>Jairus,</hi> it works manifold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, they say to him, <hi>Why trouble you the Master any further?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine is this, <hi>That the tryals and dark dispensations, that befalls the work of God, makes many discoveries, and does won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully lay open the hearts of the fainting friends of the work,</hi> Luke 24.21. The death that passed on the Prince of Life, did disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the hearts of the Disciples. <hi>But we trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (said they) <hi>that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel:</hi> And why do you not yet believe the same? O, say they because he is dead: What then? his death is the only way to restore the Kingdom, but this they were ignorant of: So <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.35. <hi>(Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108025:26"/> them:</hi> The cross Providence of God makes them go mad.</p>
            <p>Here, <hi>First,</hi> I shall shew you, why it is that such cross Providences <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ove so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll shew you, what it is that they do discover, <hi>viz.</hi> their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold mistakes about the work. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why is it that ye do thus mistake?</p>
            <p>For the First, Why is it so? I answer, First, <hi>Because thereunto they are appointed,</hi> Amos 9.9. <hi>I will sift the House of Judah:</hi> He permits them to fall out, for this end; as in <hi>Job</hi>'s case, he permitted Satan to vex him, to discourage him; yea, he actually concurs in his own holy and spotless way, with the instruments imployed about these things, 2 <hi>Chro</hi> 32.31. But, <hi>God left him, to try him, that he might see what was in his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is, <hi>Beeause then the work of God falls under sad censures from the enemies of it, because of which, a death on the work proves very discovering to the friends of it.</hi> Enemies ordinarily count it their interest, to expose his work to all the ignominy and contempt imaginable, that in the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, a foundation may be laid for excusing and commending themselves, for delivering the World from such a burthen
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108025:26"/> Thus they did with the green Tree, when they designed to put the Lord of Glo y to open shame, what <hi>Art</hi> had they to load him with all manner of ignominy, both before, and after his death: foretold by a Spirit of Prophesie, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.6, 7, 8. And exactly fulfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 37, 39, 41. And so they do with the dry Tree: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9,— 13. They were esteemed as the filth sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f shoes, every one had some filth to cast upon them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.3. <hi>They cast iniquity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pon me, and with cruel rage they hate me.</hi> Now, I say, it is this in a part that makes tryals and deaths on the interest of Christ, be so discovering, for this causes many strange thoughts of heart to be under a dispensation, that imboldens Men to say, as <hi>Job</hi> 4 6. <hi>Is this thy fear, thy confidence, and the uprightness of thy way?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They prove discove ing, <hi>because of the dark providences themselves;</hi> If ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will consider their nature, being compared to fire, whose light and heat is very discovering, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Ye shall pass thorow the Fire,</hi> or if you will consider their measure, they are call'd perfect, and oft-times are such as begets admiration, and puts the upright Man to a stand, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to think or say, <hi>Job</hi> 17.8. or if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:108025:27"/> you will consider their number, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.1. <hi>Depths upon depths.</hi> Psal. 34. <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous:</hi> Now, if one of these be discovering, how much more a compleat number of them, and in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as in our day. Now, if it may be so under tryals, it's no wonder they prove discovering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They are discovering, <hi>because of the darkness that comes along with them:</hi> The People of God meeting with such an unexpected blow, as is here in my Text, they are in the dark about God's mind and wonders, What can be his design in doing or permitting such a thing? They are in the dark about this, whether it be in love or not, and whether with the heart of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, or of a Friend, they know not; but that he will kill, and never revive his work again; <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.12. <hi>But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel; for he shall gather them as sheaves unto the floor:</hi> Jer. 8.7. <hi>My People know not the judgements of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This seems strange and proves discovering, <hi>when they look on the instruments and means that are imployed in bringing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> death on the work.</hi> And, <hi>First,</hi> they are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worst of men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79.1, 2, 3. <hi>The Heathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:108025:27"/> are come into thine Inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. Hab. 1.4, 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.24. &amp; 21.31. Now think they, if God punish for sin, then he lets the greatest sinners escape, and permits them to devour the Man that is more righteous than he; which discovered the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> they are Persons of neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est interest, Persons round about <hi>Jerusalem, Zach.</hi> 12.2. It's our Neighbours, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. and render to our Neighbours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this consideration makes strange thoughts rise in the heart, and proves very discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that friends to the work should prove such enemies to it, had it been an enemy I could bear it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.12, 13.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> thing that makes them so disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, is, <hi>the difficulty of patience under them.</hi> If these men had patience, they might have waited till they see what Christ will do. Now he is come, but they being impatient, they discover themselves presently, and cry out, <hi>The Childe is dead; Why trouble you the Master any further?</hi> Remember therefore <hi>Christ</hi>'s Exhortation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. <hi>In your patience possess your Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and Lastly, This makes it very discovering, <hi>The consideration of the Saints interest in God, and in all the blessings of the New-Covenant, their former experiences of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108025:28"/> God's gracious dealing towards them, and their considence in God in their recourse to Him:</hi> All which you see here, as is clear from what I have said concerning this Man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>se to Christ at first. Now that our Lord should step over all these things, and give a blow to his own work, and let his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient die, it is very astonishing to a serious observer. Thus much for the Reasons, why this death is so discovering.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second Thing, which is this, What is it that is discovered in them by this death, that here they Preach?</p>
            <p>For Answer to this, I shall name these Six mistakes, that by this tryal are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They mistake in that <hi>they do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Christ, as one that had out-stay'd his time, and that how-ever he knew well how to cure a Disease, yet he knew not the fit time, or may be mistaken about the season, and come too late to do any good, the Child is dead:</hi> Sir, You should have come sooner. <hi>Christ</hi> eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> comes in a good hour, and his time is bes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for us, and his work both; and how-eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thou say, if <hi>Christ</hi> had been here, there ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not been a Death on Ministers Ordinance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Professors, yet it's for the advantage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Child, of the Father, and of all concer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108025:28"/> in the Childe, that the Childe dies, and so it shall prove, as to our case in the issue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They look on <hi>Christ</hi>'s delay, <hi>as disadvantageous to the work, and that is a sad mistake;</hi> for all that Christ does, is for the furtherance of the Gospel; let him kill <hi>James,</hi> and imprison <hi>Peter,</hi> let him stay two Days, till <hi>the Childe die,</hi> that is the readiest course, and the neerest way to your promised reviving: Therefore you would believe, that his delays to do what he hath promised, and you have prayed for, do <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his work, and not obstruct, or set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;</hi> for, that holds true in this case, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderio etiam celeritas in mora est;</hi> It is true <hi>The Captive exile hasteneth,</hi> Isa. 51.14. But hold, says the Lord, <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. <hi>I am the Lord</hi> that knows my own time, a red <hi>Sea</hi> cannot make me lose an hour of my appointed time, therefore we should construct all Christ's actings to the best of advantages, and when sense says the Master delays his coming, we should say he hasteth, when sense says he is breaking down, we should say he is build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They mistake in this, in that they judge Christ such a <hi>Person as can be troubled with imployment for the good of poor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108025:29"/> Creatures, or his own more neer and dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns:</hi> Whereas there is nothing he loves more, than to be imployed; Give me no rest, says he, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.7. And this one thing <hi>Note,</hi> If any thing provoke him to be gone from us, and from these Nations, it is your not employing this Princely Mediator, that you may have your dead restored to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, please him so far as to imploy him, honour him so far as to trust him with your dead, He shall make your dead live, and together with his dead Body they shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise. If you will not make use of him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to answer his complaint, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>You will not come to me that ye may get life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their pride and mistake doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> appear in this, <hi>in that they judge it an irra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tional thing for the Father to pray, believe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it's unreasonable that you should <hi>troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They mistake in this, in that they think, that <hi>there is no help at all in Christ for reviving of the dead.</hi> It's true, might they say, he can do much, but I doubt much, if he can do any thing to a dead work. This is a most silencing thing, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.2, 3. <hi>Can these dry bones live?</hi> it almost, nay it altogether non-plusses the Prophet, and makes him say, <hi>Lord, thou knowest, for I know not;</hi> though therefore the work be both hopeless, and helpless to thee, and in its self, yet perswade thy self, he knows how to make <hi>dry bones live, and stand up before him.</hi> And therefore conclude nothing against thy imploying of him, but to the contrary, say, this is a work for <hi>Christ</hi>'s hand, because dead, and none but he can restore to life again.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> and Last mistake, is this, <hi>That they refuse to imploy Christ for their part, and do what they can to hinder others from imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him:</hi> They not only slight Christ themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, but they do what they can to take off <hi>Jairus</hi> from imploying Christ any more; and truly this is all the help that can be expected from discouraged Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: Not only are they useless them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108025:30"/> to a dead work, but are hinderers of others, so far as lies in their power; And, howbeit Men have their plausible pretences for this kind of deportment, yet our Lord will look on it, as a Hellish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, if thou slight thy duty to his dead work, and let it die and stinck both, because thou art one that will not trouble him.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the mistakes, that they were guilty of, and it is well, if we be not guilty of greater, as I might shew you, if I did not study brevity, and had resolved in this, to leave you to your silent Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the same. It's to be feared we neither think right, nor speak right of Him.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the <hi>Third</hi> Place, I come to shew the Reasons, why they, and we with them, do so mistake <hi>Ghrist</hi> in his working.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Reason is this, Our <hi>ignoranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the bounds that he hath set to all his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious acts of Providence in the Earth;</hi> whereof see, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Know me, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness▪ judgment and righteousness in the Earth, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:108025:30"/> in these things I delight:</hi> Our Soveraign Lord hath set up these way-marks for directing us what to think and say, when his way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth is hid, and in the deep waters, and his Foot steps none can see them; Let him kill, wound, cast down, or destroy, I am bound to say he is exercising loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, judgement and righteousness: And I will wait till he bring forth my righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, after he hath vindicate his own, that by our sins we have caused to be evil spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Reason of their mistake, is, <hi>Their ignorance of Christ's Order and Method in the well ordered Covenant,</hi> which is this, to kill first, and then make alive, to raise a War, and then to create Peace in the Soul, to bring order out of all our confusions, and to inrich his People, by making them losers for a time: O! for hearts to admire this well ordered Covenant, wherein he hath ordered the death of the work, and the manner of it; the reviving of his work, and the method of it. It's an old sin, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the holy one of <hi>Israel;</hi> But, can you set bounds to the Sea? No more can you limit Him. If you set Briars and Thorns before Him, He will go thorow them.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:108025:31"/>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Reason, is, Our <hi>ignorance of our own need, and of what the work stands in need of, to make it the more glorious.</hi> Sometimes it's not the sickness of our friend, but the death of our friend that will awake us, and try our faith, which is more precious than finest gold: And sometimes, it's not our sickness and sores, but a death or at lest such a cross that causes thee to choose strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, rather than life, that conduces to that glorious end, that is on our Lord's heart concerning thee, as is clear in <hi>Job</hi>'s case, and <hi>you have seen his end:</hi> Now, I say, it's our ignorance of this, that makes us so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, and be ready with <hi>Agar,</hi> to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Childe, that we do not see his death, till this prudent Dealer, for his own exaltation, by his gracious providence refute our folly.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Reason of our mistake, is, <hi>Our ignorance as to Christ's undertaking, and of the promise he gives us when we imploy H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m.</hi> I will go down, says he, and cure the Child, but he does not promise that the Childe shall not grow worse, or that it shall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> die; He promises he will build <hi>David</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> House, but he tells him, that if his Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren transgress, he will chastise them with the Rods of Men. We look to the firs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:108025:31"/> part of the promise, but not unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. We receive <hi>Christ</hi>'s promise, and we put our own Comment upon it, that destroyes the Text; But, shall it be as thou wilt? No. This is another cause of our stumbling, and foolish mistake.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Reason, is, Our <hi>not holding fast the Promise without staggering:</hi> Let all be dead, let <hi>Abraham</hi> be dead, and <hi>Sarah,</hi> as to the event of the promise, faithful <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> considers not his own deadness, nor <hi>Sarah</hi>'s either, but he considers the life that is in all his promises, and so believes, and gives glory unto God; <hi>David</hi> says, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. <hi>In God, I will praise his word, I shall not be afraid what flesh can do unto me.</hi> And you see <hi>Jairus</hi> holds fast the promise, and this keeps him at his duty, when others stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and did cast a stumbling block in his way.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> Reason, is, <hi>Their ignorance of the Person, now about the work, and that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it in hand:</hi> They thought that he was like some ordinary <hi>Physicians,</hi> that hath their <hi>Opprobria Medicorum▪</hi> and who, though they can cure some Diseases, yet as to the dead, they thought there was no cure for them; they have very poor and low thoughts of him, and this made them
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:108025:32"/> mistake: If they had remembred, <hi>that He can work, and none can let, and that there is nothing too hard for him;</hi> they should have answered their own challenge, and found there was Reason to trouble the Master (as they call it) more now, than ever before.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Seventh,</hi> and Last Reason of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, is this, <hi>Either they did not know, or now, being over-much affected with this sad provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, did not remember, and consider what cures he had wrought on others;</hi> They stare so on the Cross, that they loose both eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> the eye of sactified Reason, and the eye of quick-sighted Religion, and being thus blinded, it's no wonder they mistake; I wish we have not lost our eyes, our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like blind Men, does dreadfully testifie against us: how comes it, that we have forgotten his wonderful works? What, hath he not done them? that we might set our hope on him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.7, 8. <hi>That they might set their hope on God:</hi> You are at a loss, that have not seen his works, or if you have, you have forgotten them, and so cannot improve them, whereupon you stumble at Noon-day, as in the dark.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:108025:32"/>
            <p>Before I make any Application of this, I shall give you a wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of the <hi>Third</hi> Point, which I draw from the event, compared with this Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vidence; The Childe is cured, and great glory redounds to <hi>Christ</hi> by it, great joy and confirmation to <hi>Jairus,</hi> and great consternation, and astonishment to these that were so <hi>complementing,</hi> that if it had been their case, they would have trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Master no more about it.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine is this, That what-ever deaths fall out on his work, as they make way for the brighter shining of his glory, so all tend to the advantage of the work, and of the friends that keep closest to it, as it is in <hi>Christ</hi>'s hand.</p>
            <p>I shall not insist on this, because I shall have occasion to speak to this, when I come to the reviving of our <hi>Lazarus;</hi> Only a word may be spoken here: <hi>First,</hi> To shew you, what are these pieces of glory, that shine in this issue from death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew you wherein the work was advantaged by this Method, that <hi>Christ</hi> did take, and then Apply it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> I shall only name these <hi>Six</hi> Pieces of Glory, that shine the brighter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:108025:33"/> to us, because of the tryals, and deaths that God permits to come upon his own work: The <hi>first piece of glory that shines out of these tryals,</hi> is <hi>the glory of his wisdom:</hi> And, that, <hi>First,</hi> In <hi>wisely timeing of them,</hi> when his Peoples need calls most for such a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In wisely ordering them, the Father's Cross is, <hi>First,</hi> to have a sick Childe, and then it dies: He lays on, <hi>First,</hi> the smaller tryal, and then the greater, and he does not lay them all on together, that should sinck us in a moment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In his wise and prudent way of governing us under them, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is as one that is used to tread out the Corn, and this he loves, but our wise Lord will have him to Plow, and be at harder work, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The second Piece of Glory that shines in this, is the <hi>Glory of his Power,</hi> his right hand sustains him when friends faint, and when enemies plot and act against him, his Bowe abides in its strength: Power can as easily revive the dead, as it can cure the most ordinary disease. Now his power is seen, <hi>First,</hi> In strengthning the faith of <hi>Jairus,</hi> that might have failed at the report of the death of his Daughter; and how conspicuous is his <hi>Power this Day,</hi> in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his People under their tryals, and in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:108025:33"/>
               <hi>strengthning their faith in the promise,</hi> may you not say his right Hand upholdeth you, and underneath are everlasting Arms. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This appears in this, in inabling <hi>Jairus</hi> to <hi>slight, and despise every tentation, that did meet him in the way;</hi> they come, and tell him, the <hi>Childe is dead, Why trouble you the Master?</hi> He waves the tentation▪ and adhears to his duty, waiting carefully on his Master, that had promised he would cure the Childe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that <hi>he does help, when all hope fail'd:</hi> It's hopeless, there is no help for the Childe, yet he manifests his power, in doing that which they could not expect in reason, which they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and that which they did not believe he could do. It is easie for our Lord to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come both our faith and fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The third Piece of Glory that shines out of this Providence, is, <hi>the Glory of his Justice, in correcting and chastising his own Children:</hi> The Child falls sick and dies, such may be the sins of his People, that to vindicate his justice and holiness, he will give <hi>up his strength into captivity, and his glory into the Enemies hands, Psal.</hi> 78. The jealousie of God is very great, and will not sit down with reflections on his honour: he for the vindicating of his justice, hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:108025:34"/> his house, and given the dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his soul, to the will of his Enemies: This should make us fear and dread this Holy and Just God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The fourth Piece of Glory that shines out of it, is the <hi>glory of his faithfulness, in performing his promise, notwithstanding of all the impediments that were in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> way.</hi> Joel 2. <hi>Strong is he that executeth his word, faithful is he that hath promised, and who will also do it;</hi> he promised he would cure this Child, and before he do it not, he works a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acle; Our Lord can never be strai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned, he can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily over-come all difficulties, and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements that are in the way: Therefore let us hope in him, for neither his Saints weaknesses, nor Sinners scoffing, nor the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the case in hand; will hinder him, where his word of promise lies in pawn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The fifth Piece of Glory that shines forth in it, is <hi>the Glory of his Grace:</hi> for Grace shines forth in all, both in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of it, in his carrying it on, and in his finishing of it: There was no Merit here at all, but <hi>Christ</hi> most freely undertakes it, and most freely accomplishes it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The last Piece of Glory that shines out of it, is <hi>the Glory of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,</hi> in declaring that he hath the Keys
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:108025:34"/> of Death, and the command of it, and can untie its bonds and set its Prisoners free; <hi>O how blessed are the People whose God is the Lord;</hi> I say no more of this, only comfort your selves with these things, and don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue his work so, as to make any one of these, clash with the rest of them; and look upon all, as sweetly conducing to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the promise, and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of his glorious designs.</p>
            <p>I come to speak a word to the second.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But wherein does this way of his, advantage his work?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. First,</hi> In that this <hi>makes his work more trying:</hi> It tries the Father's faith more, it tries the faith of all his friends to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, when he lets a work die, or grow worse on their hand; It's a greater tryal to faith, to be lifting at a dead work, than when there is a little remainder of life in it, though faith triumphs most in difficult Cases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It <hi>hastens the work:</hi> For the Childe must die, before <hi>Christ</hi> come to do the work effectually: So, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. He stays two days of purpose, that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might die, and thereby he hastens his great work that he designed, which was to make his Disciples believe the more in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It <hi>magnifies his work;</hi> when not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:108025:35"/> only he cures the sick, but raises the dead to life again: This makes it a great work, he will let all die, that so we may be made to magnifie his work that Men see, <hi>Job.</hi> 36.24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It's for the advantage of the work, in this respect, <hi>In that thereupon it appears so much the more to be the work of God;</hi> His Work is oft-times call'd the Devil's work, but that all may see it to be his, he suffers it to die, and he does that for it, that neither Devils nor Men can do; and makes them consess, that <hi>this is the Finger of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It advantages the Work, <hi>In that it makes it take a deeper impression on the heart, than if it were but one ordinary Cure of some ordinary Disease.</hi> Our God will do his work so, as it may make a lasting impression on the hearts of his People: And therefore die it must, and then he revives it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It advantages the work, because <hi>Thereby he does discover the Enemies of the Work; and what is in their hearts against it:</hi> The two Witnesses must die, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. that so our Lord may make a discovery what the <hi>wicked will do and say,</hi> Now when the two Witnesses, that <hi>perplexed them, are gone; Psal.</hi> 2. Let us break his bonds, and as for this Man we will not have him to ring over
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:108025:35"/> us; these be great Heart discoveries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It advantages the Work, <hi>In silencing all the Enemies of it;</hi> Where is the Disputer now? Not one word in all their Heads: Till this end be, it can hardly be expected that our janglings shall be at an end: The cursings of <hi>Shimei,</hi> the railings of <hi>Rabsache,</hi> and the unbelieving disputings of Friends, shall at God's appearing, to build up <hi>Zion,</hi> vanish as the smoke, at the bright shining of the Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> In that it tends much to the confirmation of <hi>Jairus,</hi> who now sees that it's not a vain thing to seek him, that he is faithful that hath promised, and hath also done it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> and Lastly, It makes it a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick work, and of publick concernment to all about them, which otherways had lodged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their own Family.</hi> It shall be a rich ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when his appearing after all these deaths, shall be for the advantage of all the Nations, that shall behold his glory at his rising, and come bowing, and bending to him, and see, and say that he hath not done all this without a cause.</p>
            <p>Now all I will do for <hi>Application</hi> of the two former Doctrines; shall be, <hi>First,</hi> To give you a word of caution: And, <hi>Secondly</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:108025:36"/> To give you a word of <hi>Direction,</hi> how to carry, as it becomes the Saints, under this or the like Dispensation.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> I would Caution you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these <hi>Six</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Take need <hi>that your faith fail not,</hi> when the Wind and Seas begin to rage: It's not the raging of that roaring Lyon, nor the fury of the Oppressor, that indangers us so much as our fainting, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27.13. <hi>I had fainted unless I had believed:</hi> There is a sweet Elipsis in the words. I had done I know not what, I had fainted, I had been overcome by tentations, I had turned aside to the Flocks of <hi>Christ</hi>'s companions, unless I had believed to see the loving-kindness of the Lord in the Land of the Living.

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:108025:36"/> if at any time you find a breach made upon you, upon tryal you may find that unbelief hath made the first breach, in at which his Fatherly anger comes against thee, and you may thank your unbelief for making a way to it. This is the first word of Caution.</p>
            <p>A second word of Caution is this; <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things grow worse with you in the way of duty, blame not your self for doing of it, you have enough to charge your self with, though you charge not your selves foolishly.</hi> And as it is not good to be overmuch righteous, so neither is it good to be overmuch wicked. Neither blame thy duty so, as to disown it, or cast it off, though others call it a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Master, yet you should not do so to. It's a token for good, in reference to the reviving of a dead work, when thou art found lively in the duties that it calls for at thy hand. There is not a sader tentation, and none more dangerous, than when the Devil, or thy own Heart takes thee off from the use of promising means. This is the second Caution.</p>
            <p>A third word of Caution is this; <hi>Beware of having low &amp; straitning thoughts of Christ, when thy Case is sadest:</hi> and see that you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not your thoughts of him, as oft as he seems to alter his method and way of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:108025:37"/> towards you; Keep up <hi>honourable</hi> thoughts of him, believe he can do, and wait till you find that he will, <hi>His Spirit is not straitned,</hi> for your half faith, he will work a great Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.2, 3. <hi>If thou canst.</hi> This Man doubts of his Power, and yet it does not hinder our Lord from curing him. We are all for our measures. If I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so, and so, then he would act, (and truly I wish more care were taken to add faith to faith) and yet I should rejoyce to see faith, as a grain of Mustard-seed, that says to this Mountain be removed, and it is so; our Lord is so liberal, that if he find true faith in his people, he works <hi>great deliverances</hi> for them, and by so doing increases their faith: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest thou that he will do so, then cast by the instruments of the churl, and devise li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral things of him, and for him. This for the third Word of Caution.</p>
            <p>A fourth word of Caution is this; <hi>Beware of closing with the tentation, till first thou bring it unto Christ.</hi> This good man will not hear the voice of the tentation, until <hi>Christ</hi> hath done, oft-times betwixt the time of our first imploying of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>'s finishing the work, there falls out great tentations: Now we must take heed of them, put them in <hi>Christ</hi>'s hand, and anon he shall silence
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108025:37"/> them, and bring thee out of the many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This for the fourth word of Caution.</p>
            <p>A fifth word of Caution is this; <hi>Never regard the temptation that would make thee cast off thy promised expectation. Jairus</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the Cure of his Daughter, because <hi>Christ</hi> had promised it: The tentation says, Give over thy foolish and irrational ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, for <hi>the Child is dead;</hi> yet he holds fast the promise, and his expectation built upon it. May it not be said to us, Where is now your hope? Ah, we are drawn off from our expectation, and therefore do we so much shift about, to change our way. This for the fifth word of Caution.</p>
            <p>A sixth and last word of Caution is this; <hi>Take heed least you judge it a trouble to Christ to imploy him about his own work.</hi> Though thou <hi>had nothing to put in</hi> Christ<hi>'s hand,</hi> but a dead work brought hither to be buried in a dead Man's place; yet take courage, it's not troublesome to Christ: And it's your honour and happiness, that Christ calls you to anoint his dead work with your faith and love, with your tears and prayers; and, then invites you daily to bring it unto him, who by one word can revive it again; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge it not troublesome to him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let it be troublesome to thee to imploy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108025:38"/> him about it, or any thing else that concerns his glory, or his Churches welfare. Thus much for this Sixth word of Caution.</p>
            <p>In the last place, I shall give you some few Directions, to help you how to behave your selves in your attending upon our Lord with a dead work on your heart.</p>
            <p>The first Direction is this, As <hi>Christ does heartily welcome you;</hi> so <hi>you should heartily welcome him;</hi> come when he will, and as he pleases: Oft-times our first word to him, when he is come, puts him to the Door, or at least discovers new work for Christ, that he will do, before he do that which he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally came for, and which may be, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thy Challenge, for coming too late, or to cure thy unbelief, that looks for nothing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

If before this you draw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, and reflect on his work, and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage your selves, then you must judg again, and rebuke thy foolish hast, and learn hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth more sobriety, than to judg a work before it be done.</p>
            <p>A third Direction is this, <hi>Hold fast the promise, and plead it, till the performance of it come;</hi> our Lord takes one Day to make a Promise, and another Day for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of it; there may be seventy years betwixt the making of the promise, and the fulfilling of it, all these died in faith, not having receiv'd the promise, that is the thing promised, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>end. Psal.</hi> 119. Remember the word thou said'st to thy Servant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thou caused him to hope: <hi>Iairus</hi> does so here, and is confirmed.</p>
            <p>A fourth Direction is this, <hi>Look on all Providences as the accomplishment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, pro tanto,</hi> and in part. If it be a cross Providence, then read the promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108025:39"/> Men, and if it be favourable, then see the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54.4, 5. I have loved them with an everlasting love, and therefore with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-kindness will I embrace them: There is a <hi>promise</hi> at the heart of every providence: Open up this <hi>Golden Cabinet,</hi> and therein you shall find the Coelestial Jewels of the Promises; and with our Saviour, say, This and that Promise is this Day fulfilled, and I think our Lord is hastning his work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Wheel of Providence runs fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; O what hath God done for us in a little time.</p>
            <p>The last word of Direction is this, That <hi>as our Lord designs His own Glory, and thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, in all his Methods and Ways he takes:</hi> So you must be tender of his glory, and give unto Him the Glory that is due unto his Name: It's the height of Robery, to rob Him of his Glory: And therefore all I beg of thee, is, to render to Him according to his goodness, and make the best of all this thou can, for thy own advantage: To His Name be the Glory.</p>

               </gap>lful to go down, and by so doing, run on his own ruine; then, <hi>Let us go down, and die with Him:</hi> And, this shall put an end to this wearied life we have, and finish all our sorrows.</p>
            <p>For our present purpose, which is to hold forth the best and worst of things that are found in the resolutions of the People of God in the face of danger: I shall first shew you what this precipitant <hi>zeal is, as its found in them. A.</hi> 1. It's that which keeps the Soul from a <hi>cordial closing with Jesus Christ, and his design for a long time;</hi> they will not close with Christ here, in that which he call'd them to, for a long time, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with him; it makes even Disciples of another mind from Christ for a time; Shall we pray that Fire may come down from Heaven? You know not, sayes Jesus Christ, what Spirit you are of: It's dull at present duties, that Christ calls for, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may speak swelling words in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This precipitant zeal is such a thing, as makes men do all in a passion: It eats up consideration, and sober reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108025:40"/> or acting in cold blood. This man must be taken when hot, or then he becomes as the <hi>Smith</hi>'s Anvil, that grows the harder the oftner it be beat: Though all should leave thee, yet will not I, says <hi>Peter;</hi> it was too passionate and precipitant; therefore he gets time to consider, when brought low for his iniquity. <hi>Canis festinans,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This precipitant zeal consists in this, when Men (being at last perswaded to do that which Christ calls them to do) will over-do his commands, he calls them only to <hi>go down with him:</hi> Now, they that could not be perswaded to go with him, they will now go <hi>and die with him: Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mutatus abillo—Hectore:</hi> And, this is most ordinary, Men are either hard to be perswaded to their duty, or else over-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to that which is their sin and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, rather than their work, either they will not do what is commanded, or when, in their fits of passion and foolish zeal, they will do more, he that will not go down at first, will now go down and die. Thus much briefly for the first thing propounded from the words.</p>
            <p>The Second Thing, is, to enquire unto these things, that <hi>were commendable</hi> and real
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108025:41"/> good things, in this their resolution: <hi>We will go down, and die,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The first commendable thing in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, is this, That they are clear of <hi>Christ</hi>'s mind, and fully perswaded that he would have them to go down, before they resolve it: And, this is an excellent thing, when a Christian hath the mind of Christ. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When a Christian yields to the mind of Christ. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When a Saint builds all his resolutions upon clear Light about his Master's pleasure: Now they see <hi>Christ</hi> is determined to go down, and they resolve they will go with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is much affection in it, we will go down and die with him: Love had made them quite all for him: Love had made them refuse all, and choose him: And, now it makes them in the face of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, cleave to him: Love knows not how to let the beloved, either go alone, live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or die alone; <hi>We will die with Him.</hi> And sometimes it would redeem the life of its beloved, by its own death; or if not, it will go to the Grave with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is commendable in their resolution, that they resolve on the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cost they might be put to, they say not, <hi>Let us go down, and be pursued with him, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108025:41"/> imprisoned with him,</hi> or fired, or confined; but, <hi>Let us go down, and die with him.</hi> Death is the worst of it. <hi>Let us go down;</hi> we are resolved Christ shall not die alone, we have <hi>counted the cost,</hi> and are resolved on the worst of it: <hi>Come let us go down, and die with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In this resolution of <hi>Thomas</hi> the Twin, there is much zeal, in that he is not only free for it himself, but he stirs up all the rest to their duty: <hi>Let us go down with him.</hi> Let it never be said that we would not follow Christ, others shall stumble, if we draw back, our Master will be offended, and we our selves disgraced; come, let us therefore <hi>go down, and die with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In this resolution there was this commendable, That as they were not afraid of death, so they had hope in it, that it should put an end to all their other crosses, they eye the reward, and resolves on the worst, concluding that then it should be well with them, having ended all their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and being entred into their Master's joys, an hundred fold here, and life eternal in the World to come.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> thing, that is commendable in this their resolution, is, that they put it in present practise; as they resolve it, so they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108025:42"/> do perform it instantly, while the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is offered: It's sad, when resolutions die without performance of the thing resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon, especially when its present duty, and the opportunity of it, such as is hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away. <hi>Post est occasio calva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Seventh,</hi> is their unanimity in the thing, notwithstanding of all their former disputes and debates against it, or the probable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard that did appear in it; Let us all go down with him, as one man, and come of us what will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> In that they thought it better to be with <hi>Christ</hi> in the midst of danger, than to be absent from him, and free of these, as they might suppose. Our security is in our duty, and our principal duty, the duty of duties, is to be neer to our Master, and to keep neer to Him. To let Christ go alone is our sin, our great hazard in going with Him, is of <hi>suffering, which is none at all,</hi> so long as our day continues. Is there not twelve Hours in the day? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> v. 15. Thus much for the second particular, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for clearing of this their resolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing to be considered, is the weaknesses, or faults that are found in this resolution: <hi>Let us go down, and die with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:108025:42"/>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> fault that you may finde in it, is this, that there is little faith in it: It's true, there is some affection, but little faith, their affection to him, makes him look over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, yet they are weak at the best in faith, or then they should have resolved to go down without any apprehension of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Christians may <hi>lodg</hi> much unbelief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>covert</hi> of honest affections: Not so Master, may be, where even so, because it pleaseth thee, is <hi>not to be found;</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> our Lord answers all this with a <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi> The strongest basis of our resolutions, is our Faith; Love is sometimes very swift, but when it lacks the eye of faith, it stumbles, and oft-times runs into a snare.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Fault you may observe here, is their ignorance; Come, <hi>Let us die with Him,</hi> is a fruit of their ignorance at this time: For, 1. This was not the time wherein he call'd them to die for him: The time is coming, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.18. When another <hi>shall gird thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not;</hi> but this time was not then come. Nor <hi>(Secondly)</hi> was this the time wherein their Lord and Master was to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, there were yet some hours of the day to run out; and till these were gone, th re
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108025:43"/> was no hazard of stumbling. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they were ignorant in this, in that they thought when ever their Master was to die, they must undoubtedly die with him; this is a great mistake, he may set a death pass on himself, and his interest, and yet keep his Disciples alive, that they may publish and preach the Resurrection of that cause and interest, when he shall be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive them again: They are the Seed that he sowes to Himself, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.23. <hi>I will sowe her to my self,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Fault I finde, and you may finde it in this resolution, and that's much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction and discontentment with the thing now resolved on; they resolve thus, not so much out of choice, as out of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity: I question not but they did choose this, and that it was their love that made them do so, yet there is something like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity in the case and discontentment: Let <hi>us go down and die with Him:</hi> He will be all our deaths, and his own both, savours of little contentment; They had rather <hi>go, and die with Him,</hi> than be without Him, but if they could have their choice, they would think it far better and wiser, for <hi>Christ</hi> to go else-where, than to go to <hi>Judea:</hi> where they spake of stoning of Him the other Day.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:108025:43"/>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Fault that is in this resolution, is this, in that it rises more from their own apprehensions, and fears about things, than from the right rule; it's not right, when we make our own jealous and melancholy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, the rule of our expectation or resolution; nay, say they, he will go to his own death, this was their apprehension, well then, <hi>we will go with him;</hi> you lack no more to make you miserable, than to be given up to your own apprehensions, about the Cross. And <hi>Note</hi> this, that our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions about the Cross, are sader than the Cross it self, <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me (O Lord) for ever?</hi> This is our apprehension, but it is not in our cross, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. <hi>Wilt thou be gracious no more?</hi> that is our misbelieving apprehension. If you go down, they will kill you, and us both; that is, their deluded apprehension: <hi>I said, I am cast out of thy sight,</hi> Jonah 2.4. This is but his deluded apprehension.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Fault, is, their rashness in it, <hi>Let us go down, and die with Him:</hi> They were rash in it: And that, <hi>First,</hi> In that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve they will die, as if to die for <hi>Christ</hi> were such an easie business. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They were rash, in that they will die with him, when he did not call them to any such thing;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108025:44"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> call'd them only to go down and see <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and, they now will die with him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that they considered not, that <hi>they must not, nor cannot die in Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if ye seek me,</hi> Let those go their way.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> is, that they do reflect on <hi>Christ,</hi> as rash, inconsiderate, and wilful: <hi>First,</hi> As <hi>rash,</hi> in running himself on seen and felt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, he could not be ignorant or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of that which the <hi>Jews</hi> offered to do to him the other day, yet down he will go: And say they, it must be to die. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As <hi>inconsiderate,</hi> that he should hazard himself and them both, to see one that was dead and of whom they had little hope, or none that he should be the better for their visit And, Thirdly, As wilful, that he would g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> down contrary to the judgment and desir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the whole Church; for all the Disciple had intreated, and done what they could t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> perswade him to the contrary: We woul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> beware of any such thing as this, humb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> submission dares not say, What does thou and keeps up honourable thoughts of <hi>Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> in all his undertakings.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Seventh</hi> Fault that I find in it, is thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> In that it did proceed from a despera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> wearying of their present Lot, which make
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108025:44"/> them content to rid themselves of it, by sharp sufferings. Truly, it's a sad thing, when we are willing to run our selves on sufferings, because of present discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with our condition. Take away my life, says <hi>Elijah,</hi> for I am no better than my Fathers: And <hi>Job</hi> himself was under this piece of weakness, <hi>Job</hi> 3.11. <hi>Why died I not from the Womb?</hi> Jonah 4.8. <hi>It's better for me to die than to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Eighth</hi> Fault in this resolution is this, In that they argue <hi>a divisis ad conjuncta,</hi> they say, nay, <hi>Christ</hi> shall surely be killed by his Enemies: <hi>Ergo,</hi> So shall we. Now, this is most false every way; as the issue, in reference to both does clear: For, <hi>First,</hi> Christ died not at this time: And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> When He died, they did not die with him, He having died to keep them alive; we would beware of this deceitful way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing against our selves, or our duty.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Ninth</hi> Fault is this, that this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion carried not <hi>Christ</hi>'s word along with it▪ He had told them there is no hazard; Is there not twelve Hours in the Day? And he that stumbles, Does he stumble in the Day? They either in the heat of their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? forget this word, or then did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it so judiciously, as they should, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108025:45"/> might have done; and truly, when we slight <hi>Christ</hi>'s word, it's but sorry compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we can be to <hi>Christ,</hi> when he is going down to <hi>Judea:</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It's but a sorry expectation you can have in him. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's but a sorry estimation you have of Him; as is clear from that I have said.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> In that the thing resolved upon by them, was so contrary to <hi>Christ</hi>'s design in this whole business, they think <hi>Christ</hi> and they must die; whereas our Lord's design in staying so long, in permitting <hi>Lazarus</hi> to die, and in his going down, it was for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> sake and advantage, that they might believe, Vers. 15. <hi>Lazarus</hi> is dead, and I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there, to the intent you may believe: There is nothing less in <hi>Christ</hi>'s design, in his dispensations about you, then what you fear; There is death in your apprehensions, but none in <hi>Christ</hi>'s design: O! for hearts to bless him for this, and to study his design more than ever we have done. Thus much for the <hi>Third</hi> Thing propounded.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Fourth;</hi> What were the grounds and causes of this their Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are the grounds and causes of the weaknesses and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof.</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:108025:45"/>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> What makes them so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that they will go and die with him? <hi>A.</hi> 1. They had dedicated themselves to him, they had left all to follow him, and they knew there was none but he that had the words of Eternal Life. Now, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be without retractation, or limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; we must go wheresoever he goes, as the Wife does with the Husband. 2dly, They thus resolve, because of their love and affection to him; they resolve, nothing but death shall part them, as <hi>Ruth</hi> said to <hi>Naomi, As the Lord liveth, nothing but death shall part us:</hi> A man that hath no love to <hi>Christ,</hi> may do much, and suffer much for him, but <hi>he cannot go down and die for him, or with him,</hi> and keep up his heart, when he sees both <hi>Christ</hi> and he must die. A <hi>Third</hi> Reason of this their Resolution, was this, because they know not how to live without <hi>Christ;</hi> and seeing he will go, we will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go die with him, than live without Him: And truly, it's a brave thing, when the Christian is so much in love with <hi>Christ,</hi> that he can choose any lot or cross with Him, rather than a Throne, or Kingdom without Him.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Reasons or Grounds of their Resolution, <hi>We will go down and die with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:108025:46"/>
            <p>The Second Question is, What is the cause of all this weakness, that attends so honest a resolution? <hi>A.</hi> 1. They do not mind the word that Christ had spoken to them, and truly one great cause of our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold failings, is our slighting of the word that he speaketh to us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They did not consider that <hi>Christ</hi> had an appointed time for his work, which none could short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or lengthen, so long as his <hi>Twelve</hi> Hours lasts, there is no stumbling, Vers. 9, 10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They did not consider <hi>Christ</hi>'s call, to work at that time, and in a such a place, therefore they did mistake, for if they had considered his call, they would not have keeped up disputes with Christ; and <hi>in fine,</hi> fall unto such a passionate resolution, so full of reflections against Him. <hi>Fourthly;</hi> The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> did not consider that a Man following his calling, (be the seeming difficulties wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they will) He stears a safe course, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is he that will harm you, if you be doer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that which is right:</hi> Duty hath a doubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> security in it; The <hi>First,</hi> is from its ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nature, it's of a securing, and heart-keeping property, the word of his patience keeps thee, if thou keep it. And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your duty hath a promise annexed to it, which does strengthen thy strong hold;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108025:46"/>
               <hi>Therefore will I keep thee, Rev.</hi> 3.10. And there be <hi>Four</hi> Things, that rash Professors are much doubtful about; The <hi>First</hi> is, that if they go down to <hi>Judea,</hi> and follow <hi>Christ</hi> to a cross, they shall not get their day finished, nor their work either; but assure your self, so long as you have a day, you shall have work; and so long as you have work, you shall have a day, as <hi>Christ</hi> particularly teacheth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.31, 32, &amp;c. <hi>Go ye and tell that fox, behold, I cast out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and I do cures to day, and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. Secondly,</hi> They may be in doubt for whose cause this storm is, but a Christian in his duty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be not kept from difficulties, yet (following his calling) he is kept from the guilt of procuring them sinfully. It may be our suffering, <hi>to go down,</hi> but it's not our sin. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> One following his duty, may be assured of a blessing, but if you run out to suffering without a call, you can have no such assurance. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A man in his duty, may be assured of one, that will make up all his losses, in following of him; So says <hi>Christ</hi> to his Disciples, <hi>Not one of you that hath,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27, 28. But a Man that runs on, suffering without a call, he shall suffer loss, though he himself be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108025:47"/> saved, as thorow fire, so that the clearness of God's call, <hi>to go down,</hi> if well considered, might have afforded them more peace, then all the difficulties, they could meet with in their calling, can make void. Thus much for the <hi>Fourth</hi> Particular.</p>
            <p>I shall come now to the Application of all.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Use.</hi> Here you may see and be informed about the case, and condition of the poor People of God, that are here represented by <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who not only sickned, but died, and did now lye in the Grave, and though there were some to condole and lament the loss of him; yet none there were that did, or effectually could bestir themselves for his recovery. O how many of us are dead, and have no more but a name, that we are living! <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. Is not the holy flesh gone from us? Is there not lewdness in our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for when he would have purged us, we would not be purged? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. Is not the holy beuties from the Womb o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the morning, gone? and not only gray hairs, here and there, but pale death, sitting as the King of Terrors upon our Eye-lids: Is not the beating of the Pulse Heaven-ward gone, and instead of these breathings, for so much
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108025:47"/> of Heaven every day, and for so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; Is there not a beating of the Pulse and breathing of the Soul for so much of the World? For otherwise, saith one, I cannot live, and pay so much Rent. My Friends, if there were such an intermittant Pulse amongst the sick Patients in <hi>London,</hi> and of so long a continuance, I suppose, (with the consent of the best <hi>Physicians</hi>) many should be interred before they were really dead, our sounding fits are likest them that <hi>go down to the Pit:</hi> Is not our sleep so deep, that nothing but death seems to parallel it? Shall I say that our friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> sleepeth, <hi>and not be mistaken,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> was? I tell you plainly <hi>he is dead. And the dead of the Lord shall be many,</hi> and is it not so now? you should think it sad; if in every House the first born were dead; but, is it not a far greater lamentation, that in the most part of Houses, Husband and Wife, Children and Servants, are all dead? And, is it not yet sad, when in one Person, that was a pleasant, lively Childe, there be many dead; as, dead faith, dead convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dead resolutions, dead affections: O thou beautiful love, that was fair as the morn, clear as the Sun: what! hast thou died for cold, in the midst of a hot Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108025:48"/> Hath not all the Flames of <hi>London</hi> kindled thee again? O precious tenderness, What is become of thee? died thou as a fool, by doting on Paramours. Oh inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing painfulness, and diligence in the ways of God, Hast thou died? And, where now is the work of faith, seeing thou art gone? Where now is the labour of love, seeing thou art gone? Where now is the patience of hope, seeing thou art gone? Shall ever this Generation be exalted to honour, that are so negligent in business? You cannot stand before a King.</p>
            <p>But ah, what smell do I find, <hi>Lazarus</hi> stincketh: O sir, he hath been these four days in the Grave; nay, Ten, Twenty, or more Years in the Grave, and there is none to anoint him, that his smell may be as the smell of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and as of a green Field, that the Lord hath blest.</p>
            <p>There be three Questions I shall here propound, and answer them to you about this present case.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, wherein does the case in my Text, parallel the present condition of the People of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What are those things, that in this case the People of God must beware of?</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:108025:48"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What are the duties, that in this case, are call'd for at our hand, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our friend <hi>Lazarus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> There are <hi>Seven</hi> Things wherein the parallel does hold.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is this, that in <hi>Judea,</hi> where poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> was the better for <hi>Christ</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and was willing to have him conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue there, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is badly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they spake of stoning of him: And is it not so with the poor People of God this day, that where they have entertained <hi>Jesus</hi> the Lord, and have been entertained by him, he meets with such sad entertainment; And, may it not be for a lamentation, that our Lord and Master should be so badly requited for all the good deeds he hath done amongst us? May he not say, for which of these good deeds is it, that you speak of stoning of me? Is it for making you Christians, when Pagans? Is it for making you Protestants, when Papists? Is it for making you serious and spiritual, when formal and carnal? <hi>O tell it not in Gath, neither publish it in Askelon, least the Daughters of the Whore should rejoyce;</hi> And what Nation hath used their Idols that are not God's, as we have used him? Do you thus requite the Lord, O foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108025:49"/> And shall not his Soul be avenged on such a Generation as this?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is this, While <hi>Christ</hi> was in <hi>Judea,</hi> it went well with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he is neither sick, nor dies, nor stinks; so, while <hi>Christ</hi> was in his House, and amongst his People; O how well did it go with them! the Wall went up, and was builded, because the People of God had a mind to work: And as Error, that work of Darkness on the one hand, durst not appear before this shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sun of Righteousness, so profaness, and all iniquity stopped her mouth, had nothing to say, but this, Surely <hi>He is a great Prophet, and never Man spake as he speaks;</hi> Did not then the barren sing for joy? Was not our Wilderness turned into a fruitful Field? Did not sorrow and sighing flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Did not we prevail as Princes with God? and we had Power with Men: Did not the poor and needy sing in our Streets, because of the joyful sound? Did not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness utter its voice in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And was not our Sons of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness at Night? O how can we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber these things, and not say with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For these things I weep, mine eye, mine eye runs down with tears:</hi> But let us remember the days of old, and the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108025:49"/> Hill <hi>Mizar, Psal.</hi> 77. and 12. Vers. And rejoyce that ever he was with us, hoping that he is now for us, and will yet return unto us; <hi>We shall plowed again and sowen, Ezek.</hi> 36.10.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing is this, That <hi>Christ</hi> being badly entertained, he departs from <hi>Judea.</hi> And, is it not so with us? Hath not our strength departed from us? Hath he not forsaken his House, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7. and gone to his Place? <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.15. Hath he not torne us, and gone away? It's long since Christ said, <hi>How long shall I be with you, and that I am wearied with holding in. I will depart from you; and woe to you, when I depart from you.</hi> Are you yet ignorant of this? Or, will you command me to hold in Peace, because we must not make mention of the Name of the Lord: If I should, these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual woes of blindness, obduration of heart; unperswadableness, deadness, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and stupidity, Atheisme and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, should call aloud in your ears: And these temporal woes, on all your civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests your trading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should call aloud to you; for, because you were not sensible of the spiritual woes, God hath now smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you so, as you do feel it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.18. For behold, I will slinge out the Inhabitants
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108025:50"/> of the Land at this once, and will distress them so, as they shall feel it. But what shall I speak of <hi>Zion</hi>'s barrenness, she hath not a numerous issue, as when her Husband was with her: May she not say, I have been in pain, and brought forth but Wind. The Work of Conversion hath been at a stand; what shall I speak of the many spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual distempers amongst Professors, as to matters of opinion and practise, and what shall I more say to the removing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit far from us, both in its influences and operations, time would fail before I should give you a compleat account of the many sad evidences of his departure: Only this I shall say, that thus it is, and thus it will be, until the Spirit be poured out from on High, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.15.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing is this, That when <hi>Christ</hi> is gone, <hi>Lazarus</hi> sickens, and dies; And is it not so with as? Hath it not gone very ill with us, since he departed? Have we not call'd, but he made us no answer? Have we not sought him, but could not finde him? Hath he not been angry with our Prayers? Hath he not answered them with terrible things in his righteousness? Hath he not made us sick with smiting of us? And are not many things dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108025:50"/> that use to be alive in our Souls? Is not that lively Conscience dead, that used to be so lively in accusing, or excusing, as the matter required? Are not all our Lord's interests, and the interest of the Gospel dead? Now, if the crie of the living will not awake us, let the crie of the dead at the head of every Street; I shall then look on it, as a token for good, when these things shall begin to be revived in the hearts of the People of God, by the pouring out of his Spirit upon them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, That our Lord and Master permits all this to fall out, and seems never to Notice poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> his case, until it be altogether hopeless to sense: Now he is dead, when Christ says, <hi>Let us go down and see him.</hi> And, is it not so with us this day? If I should ask some of you, what are your thoughts of <hi>Christ</hi>'s carriage, I suppose it's somewhat like this; <hi>Master, carest thou not that we perish?</hi> You think <hi>Christ</hi> hath no care of his work and People. It's possible you may think it strange, that <hi>Christ</hi> should let it come to this pass, <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> is dead, if he mind to do any cure on <hi>Lazarus;</hi> But what, is there any thing too hard for him? and if it be marvelous in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108025:51"/> your eyes, must it be so in his? As our Lord is God alone, so sometimes he loves to work his work alone, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. Amongst all the People, there was none to help him; and when there is no Intercessor, then his right hand brings salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi>'s time is now come, for his appearing for <hi>Lazarus</hi> Resurection. The chief Men in the Church, and these that were as Doctors, in comparison of the rest of <hi>Christ</hi>'s followers; they oppose him, and disputes against <hi>Christ.</hi> There be two ways, that friends do hinder, and oppose this work now, when <hi>Christ</hi>'s time is come to do it: The <hi>First</hi> is, by disputing, as the Disciples did; if he sleep, it's well he will awake again: This comes in course; and so it's with many, let the dead work lie, it will revive again, and I hope so it will: Salvation shall arise to the People of God, whether thou be concerned or not, but take heed what may come of you, or that time, you may forsake him, and flee away.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Argument is this, It's most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to run your selves on danger and hazard: Truly, I know no good work, or greak work, that ever our Lord did, but with its own hazard: one while he is in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108025:51"/> hazard, they will make him a King, if they be well pleased with him; and at another time, they will stone him, if they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> way, that Friends do hinder <hi>Christ,</hi> when entred to work, it's by their unbelief; <hi>Martha,</hi> by her unbelief, she keeps her Brother in the Grave, for till <hi>Christ</hi> cure her of her unbelief, he raises not up <hi>Lazarus:</hi> O, the unbelief of the People of God! It hath laid many in their Grave, and keeped many longer than they might have been in it: <hi>Christ</hi> layes <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Grave, because of his Disciples unbelief, I am glad that you may believe; and he keeps him in the Grave, because of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi>'s unbeliefe: O that I could perswade you of the Virtue of Faith, and of the hurt that unbelief does to a dead <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> thing is this, that at last, <hi>Christ</hi> ingages all his Disputants, that were against the cause, to be for it, and they will now do more then <hi>Christ</hi> for it, for they will die for it, their resolution is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weakness, as you have heard: And, is it not so amongst us? Some Men they are so unwilling to do any thing, that they would be content to die, to be free of all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108025:52"/> these fears and dangers they are daily in: Could not our hearts smile on a Prison, if we could get there with credit, before we were at work in the heat of the Day? Now, put all these together, and you may have some small discovery of the estate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, this Day. And thus much for the first Question propounded.</p>
            <p>I come, in the Second Place; to the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, What is it that the Disciples of <hi>Christ</hi> have need to beware, and have a care of, when <hi>Christ</hi> begins to act for a dead <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing that the Disciples of <hi>Christ</hi> would Caution against, is this, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dispute duty, after that <hi>Christ</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his mind about it: The Cross some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produce two things, as to our duty; Either <hi>First,</hi> the Cross darkens us, and it is not so much, because of any thing in the Cross, as because of our aversation to it; and it's not so much duty we are in the dark about, as that we are seeking a duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cross, that may carry some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the duty of the day, and bear us out in our profession, with some applause only now, of a zealous man, thou art chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be a prudent man; take heed unto
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108025:52"/> this, for our God will not be mocked. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes the Cross makes us dispute, (but very modestly at first) our duty with <hi>Christ</hi> himself, <hi>If he sleep Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> &amp;c. And, now we must consult about a most clear thing, and this clear duty must be debated; and, this you may observe, that clear duties debated upon the account of the Cross, either fall in the dispute, or then are sent off the Field mutilate &amp; mank in one thing or another. O for a silent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to all <hi>Christ</hi>'s calls, and if he does not call, let us not go.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Caution is, We would at such a time watch well, that our Resolutions flow not from a bad Spring, such as misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving fear; they have a misbelieving fear, and that is the guid of their resolutions, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. <hi>Fear not their fear:</hi> It will produce some woful effect; This is but a poor thing for a Christian, in <hi>Christ</hi>'s company, to fear what flesh can do unto him: Surely in this was their snare, and would to God we were free of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would beware of making our own apprehensions, the rule of God's providence, about future contingencies: I said, says <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Men of the place will kill me for thy sake; this was a bad
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108025:53"/> rule for him to judge by: One Day, sayes <hi>David,</hi> I shall fall by the hand of my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, this was his mistake, not the rule, I said, in the cutting off of my days, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. <hi>I shall go down to the Gates of Death:</hi> This was his mistake; <hi>We are out off for our parts, Ezek.</hi> 37. This was the cause of it, they judged of future contingencies by the wrong rule. It is our great folly to make our apprehensions the rule of God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for it shall not be so, because thou thinks so, but because he hath determined or premised, that it shall be so, when appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions thus prevail, it produceth much sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Beware of misjudging, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your umbers, that pass with you for grave Counsels; Master, pity thy self, looks high with us, as savouring of affection, when our Lord looks on it, as a Satanical device, wherefore he saith to <hi>Peter, Get thee behind me, Sathan:</hi> That may seem to be a very wise and grave counsel to thee, that tends to the marring of that great work of Redemption, and the undoing of all that work, that <hi>Christ</hi> had wrought, in order to the finishing of it. And how good may thou judge that to be, that is not only the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108025:53"/> fruit of thy self-seeking, but deadly and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining to the whole design of the Gospel? It's good to be here, say they, and they would gladly have staid there, but they were mistaken, and did quickly find it was not a place to rove in, by a sudden Cloud that covered the Mount, that made it as terrible a place to them, as ever it seemed pleasant; so that they all trembled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. Have we not then reason to be jealous of our good things, least we change our Mount of Vision, unto a Mount of conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and trembling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Beware of judging any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of your hazard or pains, that our Lord counts worthy of with all his cost and travel, they thought it a poor business to undertake so dangerous a journey, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake one that is asleep, or to see the Grave of one that now stinketh in it, yet <hi>Christ</hi> thinks it worthy of his while: And is it not for a lamentation, that we should think so little of these truths, that Christ Jesus the Lord thought worthy of death, and did actually die for. That he is a King, and hath appointed his own Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: But alas, our love to himself hath decayed, and no wonder that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108025:54"/> of that wosul distinction, of smaller and greater truths, when truth is brought to the Market to be sold. It's true indeed, that there is smaller and greater truths, but none so small, as to be undervalued, not contended for, or sold, be the Price above <hi>XXX. Pieces of Silver,</hi> that was all that was given for the Master.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Take heed that you do not offer your selves to suffer, when not call'd to it: <hi>Christ</hi>'s call is, <hi>to go down;</hi> Now, they do run themselves on sufferings, without a call. I say, it's good for us to count the cost, and to be always ready on a call, but to run without a call, may be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences. <hi>First,</hi> It may be the ready way to some terrible Apostacy, and falling away; <hi>Peter</hi> will follow afar off, when <hi>Christ</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be gone, if you seek me, let these go their way, and he tells them, he would see them again at <hi>Galilee:</hi> Nay, but this resolute Man, that the other day will die with him, he now follows; and, What comes of it? he denies his Master with an oath. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This makes suffering comfortless, when Men run without a call; for, what is more comforting, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, then when you can read your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108025:54"/> call, to endure what hardness the trial may put you to. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This deprives you of God's presence in your sufferings; I will not say, but God (out of pity) may give in some testimony of his presence, but let him do in his soveraign goodness what he will, thou cannot expect, nor confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plead for his Presence in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, or in the Prison, but when thou can produce his call, and say, that <hi>it's for his Name sake you are killed all day long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Take heed, that when call'd to it, your offering your selves to die with him, be not out of weariness with your present condition, or the fruit of a fit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, as it seems it was here: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our Lord will have us to do, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer both at once; a Minister must preach with the peril of his life, and the People must eat their bread with the peril of their life: Now, the silence and security of a Prison is sweet unto them, they are so out-wearied with their present condition; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the Lord blesses their work, and gives them a good gourd, like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s, to play themselves with; and yet, like him, they are ready to say, <hi>Take away my life, for it's better to me to die than to live:</hi> or like <hi>Elijah,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108025:55"/> Take away my life, for what better am I than my Fathers,</hi> when their gourd is withered: This is a most subtil tentation, and we have reason to beware of it, and to watch against it, and to be doing, what-ever our hand findes, to do with all our might and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; having learned to be content, with whatsoever condition the Lord puts us in, judging always our present condition to be our best.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Take heed that you do not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus; <hi>Christ</hi> and his interests are or shall be in hazard there, e're he must die, and all of us die with him, though many are the troubles of the righteous, and yet the Lord delivers them out of them all; What a great hazard was <hi>Isaac</hi> in, when the Knife was lifted up to give the blow? yet he died not; And, what hazard was <hi>Moses</hi> in, when exposed to the reverence of the Waters, when a Childe? yet he died not: And, what hazard was the Church in, in <hi>Esther</hi>'s time? and yet she did not die: Was not the Apostle at perils by Sea, at perils by Land, and at perils by his own Countrey-men? yet God delivered him out of them all: you cannot do your work without hazard, but you may he in hazard,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108025:55"/> and yet escape with a King on your head, and the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> going forth before you, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. <hi>last.</hi> Don't fear, thou may finde in the issue, that these hazards have been so far from being thy death, or <hi>Christ</hi>'s, that they may be an Ordinance for good to thee, that thou may believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ever before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Let never the sense of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent hazards, make you slight the word: <hi>Christ</hi> had spoken a word to them before, that might have prevented this mistake; <hi>He is dead:</hi> v. 15. And I rejoyce for your sakes, that you may believe, but the thoughts of their hazard, swallows up all thoughts of what <hi>Christ</hi> had said to them. And I fear, the hazard that many have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, they have been in, in following <hi>Jesus,</hi> hath made many a savory word use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and to be forgotten: O that we could trust God with our safety, and make more conscience of our duty! when hazard di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts us with fear, and this fear indisposes, and unfits us for our work; then God is provoked, and that which we feared, does justly come upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Take heed of rash resolving, on the greatest of sufferings, in your own
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108025:56"/> strength; <hi>Let us go down, and die with him;</hi> They don't come, and beg strength of <hi>Christ</hi> to inable them, to suffer death with him; but, <hi>Let us go down, and die with him;</hi> It's not good to resolve in our own strength, you may be found suddenly to break it by your own folly; The consequences of this way of resolving hath been such, that some hath been frighted, from resolving any more: Thus much for the word of Caution.</p>
            <p>I come in the last place, to commend to your serious care and study, these <hi>Seven</hi> excellent things, for a Disciple under the Apprehensions of hazard in the way of duty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing, that from this instance in my Text, I would call you to, is, to study to be much in love, in a time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and tentation, love to <hi>Christ</hi> at such a time will keep you from six sad things, that Disciples are incident to, in a time when danger and duty come together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> whereof is this, They are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> danger of self-seeking; their own things, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for want of that heat of affection which here you are call'd to pursue, gets more of them then <hi>Christ</hi> does, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.32. And, is it not thus with us this day? Are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108025:56"/> we not turned to our own things, and left <hi>Christ</hi> to plead for himself? Is not our practise, like <hi>Israel</hi>'s and <hi>Judah</hi>'s to your Tents, say they, and let the House of <hi>David,</hi> the House of <hi>God,</hi> the interest of <hi>Christ</hi> see to themselves? Do we not in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, duties, and under all tryals turn to our own things, seeks them more, mindes them more, and are more affected with them, than with his: <hi>O Israel!</hi> Is this the love thou bearest to thy Friend?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Evil that it will Cure, and that is want of sympathie; If the Lord take some of us up to the Mount, we forget them that are in bonds, and at the Foot of the Mountain, and call out, <hi>It's good for us to be here,</hi> you would build Tabernacles, and enjoy <hi>Christ</hi> alone, but there is little mind of your little Sister, that hath no Breasts to suck at; or, of the many thousands that know not the right hand from the left, that are perishing for lack of knowledge: More love Christians would make you more in sympathie.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Evil is this, In times of danger there is not that antipathy at sinful courses that should be, I hate the work of them that turn aside, it shall not cleave unto me: Why, what makes this? It's love. O how
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108025:57"/>
               <hi>love I thy Law! It's my Meditation day and night:</hi> Horror took hold on me, when I see the wicked forsake thy Law; this was that holy antipathy, that his love to his Master gave life unto: It's most grievous to see, how the holy Seed hath mixed themselves with the Sons of Men, and how hath <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> mixed himself with the common People? But, what is the cause of it? <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is as a Cake unturned, he is all fired <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his affections, as to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but hath none to the things above.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Evil, that affection to our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster will cure or prevent, is, the evil of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie; <hi>Many went from him, and came no more after him, Joh.</hi> 6. Why? because they had not love to him, but to the loaves wherewith he did feed them. I am afraid that when <hi>Christ</hi> shall give his Flesh and Blood for Loaves, that is, when he shall call us to live on spiritual things for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, choose them for themselves, and with-hold the Loaves of external advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from us, that then this shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us; and, <hi>many went from him, and came no more after him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> evil, is, in time of hazard, we are apt to follow <hi>Christ</hi> afar off, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. But <hi>Peter</hi> followed afar off, Why? <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108025:57"/> love had grown cold, and all the hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> and Last Evil, that we are in hazard of, in a time when danger and duty go together, is the quitting of something of duty, either to prevent danger, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate it, this was <hi>Moses</hi> his tentation, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> would let him and the People go, if they would leave their Flocks behind them; but, What was it that brake this tenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

Not: it's our security to part with nothing, God will work out our liberty and freedom; and for us to quit any thing that he commands, were to provoke God, and to loose our selves, and liberty, both in our sin. Thus much for the first thing, I wou d recommend to your serious study.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:108025:58"/>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing I would exhort you unto, from this instance in my Text, is, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to sit down, and count the cost of your following of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the face of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when <hi>Christ</hi> calls you to go down to <hi>Judea,</hi> where you have found danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now apprehends more; it's time for you to consider, what your going down with <hi>Christ</hi> must cost you, or may cost you: Christians, there is a two-fold cost you must resolve upon. The <hi>First,</hi> is, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary cost, without which you cannot be <hi>Christ</hi>'s, nor serious Christians; And this consists, <hi>First,</hi> In this, you must be at the necessary cost of digging of the ground, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Break up your fallow ground;</hi> it is impossible you can be <hi>Christ</hi>'s Disciples, till this be; If Christianity be a new building, it necessarily calls for this, that you must be at pains to dig up these corruptions, and break down these old high imaginations, and disputings, that are found in the heart, against <hi>Christ,</hi> his commands, and that Righteousness that is by Faith; when you build on old ruins, this▪ makes a breach in your new walls, and is a building of gold on stubble, that the Fire will burn up; <hi>There are</hi> (says <hi>Solomon) that makes themselves pure, and yet they are not washen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108025:58"/> from their old iniquity;</hi> I doubt not, but the neglect of this, is the cause of many's turning aside to error in judgment, and to loosness practise, that have bid fair for Heaven.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Piece of this necessary cost, is this, that Christians that would be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and follow <hi>Christ,</hi> in midst of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they must be at the cost of laying a sure foundation, this is most necessary; for, if the Disciples had not laid this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they could never have continued with <hi>Christ,</hi> when many others have gone from him, but this keeps all sure; <hi>Whether shall we go from thee, for thou hast the words of Eternal Life:</hi> This is the Foundation that must be laid, after all thy humbling work. And this <hi>Note,</hi> that what ever measure of this humbling work does convince thee of, thy need of <hi>Christ,</hi> makes thee willing to close with him, and restles till you get him, is sufficient, and all other debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Law-work are utterly vain. O blessed Soul, that is fitted to receive <hi>Christ</hi> for thy wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It's necessary you build a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structure on this foundation, therefore the Holy-Ghost presseth us, to build up our
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108025:59"/> selves in the most Holy Faith, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. It's not enough to lay the Foundation, but there must be a superstructure; This evidenceth the truth of the foundation; and that it's well laid, when you build on it: And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he be that pretends to <hi>Christ</hi> for a foundation, and does not build his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's love, his peace, his joy in the Holy Ghost, his increase of grace, his perseverance therein to the end, together with a High Throne of preheminency for the Master-builder, and that in reference to the Souls love and subjection, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Hangings of Holiness to the Lord, may much suspect, whether ever the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was laid or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is this piece of necessary cost, that we must be at pains for, and that is, to get the North and South Wind to blow on our Souls; work we must, but our strength to do it, depends on God's assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the influences of the Spirit: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee I can do nothing, but with thee I am able to do all things, all things through Christ that strengtheneth me.</hi> The neglect of this is the cause of our deadness, and disputing against our duty: It should make us as the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> and make every day, a day of his Power; but, <hi>for this, mine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108025:59"/> eye, mine eye poureth out tears, because the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter that relieveth our Soul, is far away from us:</hi> And, this I must say, that there is no hope of better days, of more fruitfulness and zeal for God, until this Spirit be pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out from on high, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.15. And till he rain down Religion and Righteousness upon the Earth, that of all commodities are the rarest, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is this necessary piece of cost you must resolve upon; and that is, to fetch wind from all providences, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten your journey home, and to advance your building; Does the wicked prosper? then you must fear the Lord, and speak of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to one another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. Have such as turn aside to them, waters of a full Cup poured out, then say, <hi>It's good for you to draw neer to God?</hi> Are you killed all the day long, then say, <hi>In all this we are more than Conquerors? Rom.</hi> 8. and that neither death nor life, shall <hi>separate you from the love of God in Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Take this piece of necessary cost, you must go about the building, with a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect eye, beholding your failings, and with a mournful eye lamenting over them, thou must water every stone with thy tears of repentance, as thou must build up by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108025:60"/> thy Faith: Now, if these things be in thee, be the danger what it will, thou shalt never fail, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Thus much for the necessary cost a Believer must resolve upon, and must be put to.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, that contingent cost; as, for Example, his being stoned at <hi>Judea,</hi> or going down thither again: This is but an accidental piece of expenses, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must resolve upon, but it's only pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but not always necessary, that every Christian meet with them, such as fighting with Beasts at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> such as that, at my first Answer, no Man stood by me; such as that, to have Master-builders falling at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference about the building, as here, and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. such as that, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. <hi>last.</hi> 25.26. <hi>My heart and flesh fails me, yet I must follow Christ, notwithstanding it fall out so to be:</hi> And such as that, we see not our signs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we a Prophet that can tell us how long, yet in dark we must follow <hi>Christ,</hi> as in the clear day, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8, 9. <hi>I sit in darkness, yet the Lord will be a light unto me:</hi> We may be put to die for <hi>Christ</hi> indeed, and it may be otherways we must resolve it.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Summum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori</l>
               <l>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.</l>
            </q>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:108025:60"/>
            <p>I only name these, <hi>First,</hi> Because they are not every Christians tryal, and I love not to trouble you with that which you possibly may never see. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because when they come, they come with fear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and I have no will to torment you before the time; Only thus, I press upon you, that you would be resolute, come of you what will in <hi>Judea,</hi> count upon it, and it shall make your Cross easie when it comes, and your disappointment sweet, if it don't come.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing that I call you unto, from what is said, is this, when you have counted what is the cost, then resolve on it; they count that it will be death to them, yet say they, <hi>Let us go down, and die with Him:</hi> What, die with him! why not die for him, and keep him alive: if he live, he can raise you again: Nay, say they, it will be his death, and ours both; but, seeing he will die, he shall not die alone, <hi>We will go and die with Him:</hi> Are you resolved to follow <hi>Christ</hi> on any tearms, at the dearest rate? <hi>Thou shall never repent it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would press you unto this, from what is said, judg the loss of <hi>Christ</hi>'s company, upon the slighting of your duty, as the greatest loss of all; if we go with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108025:61"/> him, we may die with him; but, if we don't, we shall surely loose his company and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship; Therefore, say they, <hi>Let us go down and die with Him:</hi> It's prodigious to see, for how small a trifle, we loose <hi>Christ</hi>'s company, and when we have done it, how little we are moved with it; though every thing says, thy strength is departed from thee, thou wilt not regard this, till thy dead be brought in, in companies to thee, with his account of them, <hi>My Brother had not died, if Christ had been here;</hi> my tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, zeal, diligence, painfulness, and love had not died, if <hi>Christ</hi> had been here: The loss of <hi>Christ</hi> is a matchless loss, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loose such another in Heaven, or in Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I pray you, be much in stirring up one another to known duties, especially when they are dangerous; so does <hi>Thomas</hi> here, <hi>Let us go down,</hi> says <hi>Thomas,</hi> to the rest of the Disciples; It's not enough for us to stir up our selves, but we should stir up one another; Provoke one anotner to love and good works, we must look dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, least not only we our selves fail in the grace of God, but least any Man fail in the grace of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. When thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren: Oh
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:108025:61"/> for more of this amongst the Professors of this Generation, but be sure to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vain-glory, or that supercilious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of these, to whom you owe that duty of love, remembring this, that one may rise many hours after you, that may go to Bed before you; for, such as are first shall be last, and the last first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I pray you consider, that the worst you can suffer, in following of <hi>Christ,</hi> it's but death that puts an end to all your desertions, distractions, afflictions, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations: It's that blessed out-let from sin, and that in-let to glory; well, this made the Disciples willing to go down, when death looked them in the face, that if it came, and the matter sell out so, that they should die, why then, they should bid a farewel to all their other tryals, fears, darknesses, tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wearyings, and wandrings they were subject to. Christians, Why are you so moved at the approach of your friend and servant? Was <hi>Rebecca</hi> so moved, when she understood that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant was come for her, to the Marriage of his Master's Son, and what a greater than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> or <hi>Isaac</hi> is here? what Christians should we be so afraid of the King's Chariot, that is come to carry us home to that place, he
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108025:62"/> hath prepared for us? No, let us be more acquainted with death, and understand, and take up the right notions of it, and then it shall not be a difficult thing for us, <hi>to go down, and die with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> When ever <hi>Christ</hi> calls for duty, and you resolve upon it, make conscience of performing your duty resolved upon, without delay; they say not, stay till the heat of the fury go over, and then go down; or send down, thou needs not go thy self; or, if thou go down, we will stay here and do some work, and we will come to thee, when we see the danger is over, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently they put that in practise, they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved upon, and resolves they will take the first brunt of the Battel with <hi>Christ:</hi> O how commendable is this in a Christian, when he doth not defer to pay, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. I was not, says <hi>David,</hi> as one that lingers, <hi>I made haste to keep thy Statutes;</hi> The more we shift present duty, the more indisposed we grow, and unfit for it within, the more tentations we have against the performance of it from without, and the smaller measure of assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we have for doing of it from above. And therefore, as I would recommend to you the study of your duty in your day; so make conscience of doing that which is the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108025:62"/> duty of the day in its day. And by this, you shall finde your work easie, tentations few and weak, influences strong, and God's Presence with you in it, preventing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, and sufficiently protecting you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all these feared dangers, that made you dispute against <hi>Christ</hi>'s commands and promises, the other day. And thus much for this Resolution of the Disciples about their duty in the face of danger; Let him that reads understand.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving, in my former <hi>Discourse,</hi> spoken to the several deaths that may befall <hi>Christ</hi>'s work and Interests, and that after he hath undertaken to heal the Disease, and is sound on his way to that effect, yet it may grow worse on his hand.</p>
            <p>I come now from this place, to <hi>shew you, that what-ever befall a work in Christ's hand,</hi> he will finish and perfect it, <hi>Thy Brother La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus shall arise:</hi> that is, the poor afflicted People of God shall be delivered from the pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt sad condition they are in, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their former happiness, whose poor and low condition is here represented to us by <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:108025:64"/>
            <p>Before I come to that which I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intend, I shall premise these <hi>Five</hi> Things from the Con-text; The <hi>First,</hi> is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is, <hi>That our Lord hath a different way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the friends of his work, according to their different exercises about it, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their concerns in it.</hi> The Disciples they are only exercised about a sleeping and dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and our Lord entertains them with no other thing, but with the news that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead; and they speak of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death, so that first and last, death is the subject of their discourse, but you see, when <hi>Martha</hi> comes, they fall on a more comfortable discourse, and they only speak of the rising and reviving of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Thou may be one that can keep up confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with <hi>Christ,</hi> about a dead work, and in thy dispondency, preach thy own death next, <hi>Let us die with him;</hi> when others are profitably conversant about the reviving of it, before the Lord. The cause why most of us finde little of him, or of his mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our low and hopeless-like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is the lowness of our Spirits, and the lowness of our exercise about it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I would premise is this, <hi>That Faith in its noble actings, always findes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108025:64"/> suitable entertainment at Christ's hand,</hi> v. 22. She acts faith, <hi>Whatsoever thou asks of God, God will do it,</hi> What may our Lord say? Does thou thus believe? Then sayes he, v. 23. <hi>Thy Brother Lazarus shall arise.</hi> It's a great favour to meet with a speaking <hi>God,</hi> in order to the particular case, we lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and this is the favour, that here her faith meets with: yea, so great is our Lord's respect to faith, that he bestows fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours upon it, above the desire and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the believer; <hi>Thy Brother shall rise.</hi> Our unbelief is the cause of our bad accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when we come to him about his work: Sense says, it's dead, and there we leave it stinking, in the Grave, but don't at all exercise one act of faith about it; and, this makes us come, and go away wearied, in fear, and with great jealousie, because there is no Answer from the Lord.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing I would premise, is this, <hi>That how-ever all the Saints be excellent, yet their excellencies are various:</hi> One may be excellent in mourning over a dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as <hi>Mary;</hi> the others excellency may lie in wrestling with <hi>Christ,</hi> for the Resurrection of a dead work, as <hi>Martha</hi> One may run faster than the other, while going to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108025:65"/> where their Lord was laid; The other may have more courage, to go down to the Sepulchre, to see what hath come of Him, and to know really that he is risen. This makes a sweet harmony in the body, every Member having its proper excellency, and should revive that charity, and respect, that we owe to others, that want not their own excellency, though they have not such an excellent eye, as thou hast.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing I would premise, is this, <hi>That one Christian may very far out-go ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in their zeal and activity, about a dead work, when things are very low.</hi> Here <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> out-strips <hi>Mary,</hi> and anon <hi>Mary</hi> out-strips <hi>Martha; Martha</hi> rests not till she get <hi>Lazarus</hi> up, and when this is done, she trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles her self with much service. It may fall out, that one much concerned about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of others, may fall careless of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or of that better part, which is most of their concernment. <hi>Mary,</hi> upon the other hand, is so concerned about her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that she does not neglect her own case, nor her principal duty to <hi>Christ,</hi> that is <hi>The Resurrection and the Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I would premise th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, <hi>That such as are most concerned about his work and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:108025:65"/> they meet with the earliest discoveries of its reviving.</hi> Therefore here you see Christ intimates this to her, <hi>viz.</hi> The reviving and resurrection of her Brother, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2 4. There is a young Man, much concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> well, what is the favour that this young Man shall receive for his encouragement, v. 4. <hi>Run speak to this young Man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited, as Towns without Walls:</hi>— v. 5. <hi>For, I will be to her a Wall of Fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</hi> Till we be more concerned about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it's not very like, that we shall either hear or see great things about it. Thus much from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of this purpose in hand, with what goes before, and follows after.</p>
            <p>From the words themselves, I shall give you this one Proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That what-ever work Christ undertakes, and howsoever attended with invincible difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet he will finish and perfect it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all.</hi> For proof of this, see <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>As for God, this work is perfect.</hi> Psal. 138. last. <hi>My God will perfect that which concerneth me.</hi> And, it's that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle incourages his hearers with, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He that hath begun a good work in you, will
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108025:66"/> also perfect it unto the end:</hi> And, it's in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of this, that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> prays, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace, perfect, settle, strengthen, and establish you.</hi> If he undertake the redemption of his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he carries it on till he hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished it, notwithstanding of all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that were in the way. Intends he to build his House, and does he undertake it, and puts <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to work about it; he carries it on, notwithstanding of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that were in the way; Does he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the delivery of his People in <hi>Esther</hi>'s days? He finishes it: And does our Lord undertake the Work of Man's Redemption from sin and Sathan? Why, he finishes it, and that over all opposition from Men or Devils.</p>
            <p>In speaking to this, I shall shew you, <hi>First,</hi> When may <hi>Christ</hi> be said to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any Work, in the behalf of His People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What be the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or difficulties that do usually attend <hi>Christ</hi>'s undertaking his Work, and for his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why will our Lord undertake a Work attended with so many difficulties, and will not (until then) appear for it.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:108025:66"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What are these great things he will do, before a work undertaken by him be not accomplished and perfected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What is the manner and way of <hi>Christ</hi>'s acting, when he comes to finish his work, and to raise up a dead <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I shall Apply it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> which is this, <hi>When may Christ be said to undertake a business for his People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. When he leads <hi>in his People to a formal Bargain and Covenant with Him, wherein he</hi> promises to them, and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21, 22, 23 <hi>Who is this that ingageth himself to approach to me?</hi> Thy ingaging is as a Chariot that <hi>Christ</hi> presently goes up unto, and therein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests himself an Undertaker of thy Work, when you are made a willing People, then says he, <hi>I will be your God, and you shall be my People,</hi> Psal. 50. <hi>Call on me, and I will deliver you,</hi> Psal. 91.11, 12. <hi>Because thou hath set thy love on me, therefore will I deliver you.</hi> Their ingaged affection, does ingage his Power to appear in their deliverance: If <hi>Christ</hi> say, go to the Vineyard, and you shall have what is convenient; It's a good evidence, <hi>he hath undertaken the work.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:108025:67"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then may <hi>He be said to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a work, when he ingages under Work-men about it. Christ</hi> here ingages all the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples about this affair, you know whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Man, not only Covenants with one about such a House, but he bespeaks his Work-men, that must be imployed about the Work, that is a good evidence he hath undertaken the Work, and so it is in the case in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then may he be said to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Work, <hi>When he gives his tender eye of inspection to the Work:</hi> When his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye is over it, in the storm, and in the clear day, in the Furnace, and out of it: <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. <hi>I the Lord do watch it, I do water every Morning, yea every Moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Then may our Lord be said to undertake his work, <hi>when his People and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have a mind to work,</hi> Neh. 4.6. <hi>The People have a mind to work:</hi> This joyns the Wall together, and makes it go up, <hi>Phil</hi> 2.20. <hi>I have none so minded,</hi> says <hi>Paul,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the commendation of <hi>Timothy, that will naturally care for the things of your souls,</hi> then the Saints and Servants of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are of a noble mind, they mind the work, and they have a mind to all that work that it calls for.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:108025:67"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When <hi>Christ Jesus the Lord, is affectionatly concerned about the work,</hi> and the low condition of the friends of it. <hi>Jesus wept.</hi> You may see him ingaged in his sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. <hi>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my People, I will come down and save them:</hi> When he saw their faith, he was presently ingaged, and to work he went, and said to the poor Man, <hi>Rise, take up thy Bed, and walk.</hi> It's a very sad thing; when his sympathy is denyed us, or when the Church grows jealous of it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>Where is now thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and thy mercies.</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily then we fear casting off, and that he will not do our work for us; but, when his repentings kindle within him, and his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are not restrain'd, the People of God then do judg that he hath undertaken, and that if he can do any thing, that he will do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Then may he be said to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a work, when <hi>he receives an earnest from his poor People, when he receives and accepts of a Sacrifice;</hi> There is no doubt but he hath undertaken it. If a Physician or Council re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your money, then you think, that he hath undertaken to cure, or consult and plead to the best advantage for your cause,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:108025:68"/> So here, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.23. <hi>If he had a mind to destroy us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering at our hands:</hi> And truly, if God hath accepted Prayers, Fasts and Sufferings, in the behalf of his dying work, it seemeth he hath undertaken, and will finish it in a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Resurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Therein doth ones underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a work appear: <hi>In his removing all things that hinder the advancement or carying on of this work,</hi> as our Lord does here: he silences the great Masters of Reason that disputed against his Undertaking, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the unbelief of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> and commands them to rowl away the Stone: And, if you despise this day of small things; Then, <hi>Lastly,</hi> shall you be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <hi>when he shall effectually do his work on Mount Zion and Jerusalem;</hi> and cause <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> to rise up out of the Grave, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.10. <hi>For, who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoyce, and shall see the Plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel,</hi> &amp;c. Thus much for the <hi>First</hi> Particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Second,</hi> What are the disadvantages or difficulties that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of <hi>Christ</hi>'s is attended with?</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:108025:68"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. This undertaking of <hi>Christ</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with this disadvantage, <hi>He is now at a distance from his work:</hi> Here is distance in the case, And this is very sad in it self to be at a distance from <hi>Christ</hi> at any time, but far more sad is it, when <hi>Christ</hi> is at a distance, when there is so much work to be done, and when none can do it, but Himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here <hi>is great danger in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;</hi> Ask the Disciples, and they will tell you, this undertaking will prove <hi>Christ</hi>'s ruine, and theirs too, as I have shewed you from their resolution, to <hi>go down and die with him.</hi> And truly to sense, there was no small hazard, seeing not long before they spake of stoning of <hi>Christ</hi> there, where now his work lies, and to which place he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to go.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here <hi>is death in the case:</hi> The Work that <hi>Christ</hi> undertakes, is both hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and helpless in it self, and to all friends concerned in it, <hi>Lazarus is dead;</hi> What hope can there be of his reviving? or what help can be made to him now, when dead? Yet notwithstanding of this disadvantage, the Prince of Life, that hath the Keys of Life and Death, undertakes the work, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.2, 3, 4. He was at a non-plus, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108025:69"/> with one question about such a case, <hi>Can these drie bones live? Lord, thou knowest.</hi> He neither had hope, nor knew he of help, but turns over the case to be solved, and the work to be done by him that only was able: and it were our wisdom to do so, without farther disputing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here <hi>is rottenness in the case:</hi> By this time <hi>he stinketh,</hi> saith <hi>Martha,</hi> and I pray thee, Master, don't dishonour your self, by undertaking a work that will but bring a bad savour on all that medles with it. We can only bring a bad savour on the great concerns of <hi>Christ;</hi> and when he is ready to remove that, we ordinarily do what we can, thorow our weakness, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Here <hi>is continuation in a sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> It was not of a day or two, but he hath now been four days in the Grave: To lye long in a sad condition, is a great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Undertaker of the Cure; Then <hi>Physicians</hi> dare promise nothing, their hopes are small, and with <hi>Martha,</hi> they can say, if we had come a little sooner, we could have cured him; but, now the disease hath layn so long on, that there is little can be done, Death only is to be made easie; yet
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108025:69"/> notwithstanding of this, our blessed Lord undertakes the Work, and finisheth it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> There <hi>is Division in the case:</hi> When <hi>Christ</hi> undertakes this Work, all the best of the Church are of a contrary mind, &amp; divide in their Opinion from <hi>Christ,</hi> they do not like his undertaking, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it both rash and irrational, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a work of so great hazard, where there is so little hope, to do any good to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties principally concerned, yet he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it, knowing how to unite those in the issue, who stumble so much at his first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; And truly, it's usual that those that break amongst themselves about the means, do agree, when the end desired by both is attain'd, which falls out ordinarily about the reviving of a dead work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> There <hi>is hard censuring in the case:</hi> If <hi>Christ</hi> say, I will destroy this Tem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:108025:70"/> Undertaker <hi>cannot fail, nor be discouraged, till he hath done his work:</hi> Isa. 42.4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> There <hi>is singularity in the case:</hi> And, this is no small discouragement, there is none for the work, but <hi>Christ</hi> alone. <hi>At my first Answer,</hi> (says <hi>Paul) none stood with me:</hi> This was a great tentation, yet his Master stood by him, and strengthned him, but here not one of the Disciples is found to stand by <hi>Christ</hi> as this undertaking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> There <hi>is opposition in the case:</hi> he not only had none with him, but such as were not for the work, though they would die with him, yet he meets with much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position from them. For, <hi>First,</hi> the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they oppose him by their disputing, thereby labouring to disswade Him from undertaking the work. And, <hi>Secondly, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> by their unbelief, they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, till he hath removed this out of the way; And, as I have told you: <hi>It's very sad, when Ministers unbelief is the death of Lazarus;</hi> and provokes <hi>Christ</hi> to permit him to die, <hi>that you may believe;</hi> and when Professors unbelief keeps <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Grave: Now, when <hi>Christ</hi> is come to raise him; but he will do nothing in this; Till,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:108025:70"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> He hath cured thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>belief. Thus much for the <hi>Second</hi> Thing propounded, which is the discouragement that does at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Christ</hi>'s undertaking.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing propounded, to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, is to give you the Reasons, why our Lord undertakes a work, attended with so many disadvantages and discouragements.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Reason I give you of Christ's undertaking of this Work, is, <hi>His call to it: Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> call'd him, and <hi>therefore came he into the World, to do such work as no other Man can do.</hi> Nay, the Work it self did call for him, every beating of the Pulse, every groan, and sigh of a deadly wounded Work call'd him, the bad savour that was now on <hi>Lazarus,</hi> call'd him to work. Now to teach us to follow God's call over all difficulties, he obeys the call, and considers not the difficulties, knowing that in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his calling, these should either vanish or else be overcome.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Reason is this, <hi>Because the work now was taken out of the hands of all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and was beyond the reach of ordinary means,</hi> he is dead and stinking: they can do
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:108025:71"/> nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> And oh that there were more of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or a dead <hi>Lazarus:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he undertakes it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43.13. <hi>I will work, and who shall let it?</hi> neither Disciples disputing, nor <hi>Martha</hi>'s unbelief can let him, he will cure all in his own way.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Reason is this, <hi>Because this was a work he reserved for his own hand, and for the advancing of the great design of the Gospel;</hi> which is, <hi>That all Men should ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son,</hi> Joh. 5.23. <hi>By believing in him, as they believe in God,</hi> Joh. 14.1. Now, our Lord will never slight a work, how hard soever that lies at his Door; and, therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.16. <hi>I brought him to thy Disciples,</hi> (says the poor Man) <hi>but they could not heal him;</hi> well, says Christ, <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. <hi>Bring him hither unto me;</hi> this is a work I have reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for my own hand; <hi>I will do it:</hi> The work is safe, when at <hi>Christ</hi>'s Door, and when Disciples have done all they can, though they cannot revive it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> Reason, why he undertakes a work attended with so many difficulties, is, because <hi>it's for his Friends,</hi> who ordinarily fall all dead with a dead work; What will he not do for his friends? especially when
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108025:71"/> their necessity calls for it, he that gives himself, will he not work, and do all things for them. And, this is comfortable, to think that <hi>Christ</hi> will undertake a work at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with so many difficulties, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when his friends (for whose cause he undertakes it) are so unworthy of any such favour.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> Reason is this, <hi>Because thereby He gets himself a great Name, and a great praise,</hi> and thereby does much strengthen the stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering faith of the friends of the work: <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.10. So <hi>didst thou get thee a great Name, as it is this day:</hi> And as he promised to <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.9. <hi>That he would make Him a great Name:</hi> so by his undertaking, he that was the Anti-type, gets a great name to himself. It were good, if we were pleading his name more, to perswade him to undertake and finish the reviving of our <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Sixth</hi> Reason is, <hi>That he may attest the liberality of his heart to the Sons of Men;</hi> we have narrow limiting, and unworthy thoughts of him, that he will not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing about dry bones, or dead Souls; Now he does this, to convince us
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108025:72"/> of the contrary, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41.17, 18. <hi>The poor and needy want water, and their tongue fails for thirst.</hi> Now they must the for lack of water; No, says the Lord, <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>I will open up Rivers in the Wilderness, and streams in the Desert; I will hear them; I, the God of Jacob will net for sake th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and Lastly, <hi>Because, as he daily works, so he hath some one or other work that is call'd a Generation work, that he does for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of that Generation, and for the following, that when they fall under a deaths, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his works of old, and set their hope on Him,</hi> Psal. 78.7. <hi>That they might set their hope on him:</hi> This sort of work, I conceive, that word especially holds forth, which you have, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.4 <hi>One Generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy Mighty Acts;</hi> wherefore this in may Text is a signal one, being the Resurrection of one that now stinks in his Grave, and of many in him. Thus much for the <hi>Third</hi> thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reasons of <hi>Christ</hi>'s undertaking at this time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Thing to be spoken to, is, What great things <hi>Christ</hi> will do, before a work undertaken by him, be not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and perfected.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:108025:72"/>
            <p>For Answer unto this, I shall propound these <hi>Seven</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> whereof is this, <hi>He will venture his Lazarus, and let him the and stink in the Grave, before he have not his intended work perfected:</hi> which is, that <hi>they may believe:</hi> And truly, it's a great matter for so kind a Master, to suffer one of his best beloved Servants to be brought so low; But, that is no matter, if thus it must be, before he can finish his work, thus it shall be, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. <hi>He gave his strength unto captivity, and his glory to the Enemies hand.</hi> Why? this he does, that he may accomplish his design of punishing the hypocritical Professors in the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> and get himself the more glory, in bringing back of both again. And be sure, it's not a small thing for him, to give up his strength unto captivity, and his glory to the Enemies hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Very <hi>weak means, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, shall not want his countenance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, if they he used about the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his dead work:</hi> Weak <hi>Martha</hi> wants not encouragement in this case, and this is great condescendence, that so great a one; should thus humble himself, to regard so
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:108025:73"/> weak an Instrument: but our Lord will not despise the weakest Woman among you, when in the exercise or faith, about that work that he hath undertaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our <hi>Lord will not spare his pains, when his dead hearted People calls for it; in order to they reviving:</hi> He will go on foot to <hi>Judea,</hi> to perfect his cure, and finish his work on a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he can stop over di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and be as a Hind and a Roe on the Mountains of Separation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>He will not stand on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hazard, or danger, that Men may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that undertaking will bring him to;</hi> Let them be all Devils in <hi>Judea,</hi> he will go down, seeing his work calls for him; And truly, it's a great matter, when one is not skared by seen and feared danger, to finish the work that God calls them to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Our Lord Jesus will think nothing to step over all the sinful miscarriages of his friends about the work, rather than the work should lie unperfect:</hi> He steps over the peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish humour of the Disciples, and the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Martha,</hi> before his work be not done
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:108025:73"/> that he had undertaken. Our weaknesses should humble us, but they cannot hinder him, notwithstanding of their <hi>failings,</hi> he does his <hi>work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Our Lord, <hi>Before his work be not done, he thinks nothing to cross, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the whole Church:</hi> and so he does here, he contradicts them, and ingages them to go down with him, very cross to theirs own inclinations, and to that light they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Upon <hi>the easiest intreaty he will be prevail'd upon to do great things,</hi> Jer. 33.3. <hi>Call upon me, and I will shew you great and mighty things:</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2.21. <hi>Be glad and rejoyce, for the Lord will do great things:</hi> There are <hi>three greats</hi> that the Spirit of God in the Scripture seems to glory in, and <hi>Christ</hi> will make us experience them all, before his work be undone, upon a very small intreaty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First great,</hi> is great faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness, great is thy mercy, thy greatness is unsearchable, therefore he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes great works upon the smallest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108025:74"/>
            <p>The <hi>Second great,</hi> is great sins, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Pardon my iniquity, for it is great:</hi> and this he does on easie tearms, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. I said, <hi>I would acknowledge my sin, and thou for ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest me the iniquity thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> great, <hi>is great deliverances: So David</hi> declared, that he gave great deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances to his King, a part whereof was this He prevented him with the blessings o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> much for the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing propounded, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be spoken to.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> way that I observe he hath on Earth, in doing great works, and in revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Zion</hi>'s dead, after he hath undertaken this work, is this, by <hi>weak and contemptibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Things are in their effect, as he will have them, though they be never so cross thereunto in their own natures: The turning of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> into Chalk-stones, by his appointment, will serve to purge away <hi>Jerusalem</hi>'s Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In his doing of his work, that he undertakes, <hi>He does it most compleatly:</hi> He leaves it not half done, when he begins, he makes an end, whether in his works of mercy or justice; the wicked, they scorn him, and say, Will he make an end in one Day? but what-ever days he take to do his work, he is sure to compleat it, e're he leave it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. <hi>As for God, his work is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By all the <hi>deaths upon his work and People, he advances his great design,</hi> and if he kill, he quickens by killing, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up:</hi> If blood be sowen about <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> like Water, it proves the Seed of the Church; and hence
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108025:75"/> it is, that the Man that is acquainted with God, when he sees all this, he says, <hi>There is a building up, and that he saves the Island of the Innocent,</hi> Job 22. last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He does it <hi>in his own time,</hi> Isai. 60. <hi>last.</hi> It's in his time: <hi>In an acccptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have I helped thee:</hi> And this is here, when <hi>Lazarus</hi> is dead and stinking; he will not come before his time, for then it should prove a snare to us; nor after it, for then it should prove dishonourable to him; his Saints, by all their crying, shall not make Him come a day sooner, and yet they must call and cry; nor shall his Enemies keep him one day longer, away from his People, with all their threatnings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our Lord's manner is this, <hi>He uses to speak to his People about it, before he do it: Moses</hi> is sent to speak to the People, before he revive them with that temporal deliverance. And, <hi>Christ</hi> here speaks to his Disciples, and to <hi>Martha,</hi> about this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, before he works it: <hi>O for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that knew, or that could tell Us how long.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="137" facs="tcp:108025:75"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He does it ordinarily, <hi>over a-multitude of difficulties:</hi> O what difficulties are there in this case in hand, as I have shewed you: There is never a great work he hath done, but it hath been over a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of discouragements, as you may see in all his workings of old, in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He does his work, but so, <hi>as to affect his People first with it. Jehosaphat</hi> must be concerned about his work, and the case that all was in, and say, <hi>We know not what to do,</hi> before ever the Lord do it; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Ezekiel must be set in the midst of the Valley of dry Bones, before they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived:</hi> We keep too long about the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of them, but we must get in to the heart of his affairs, and see things in their blackest colours; Here you see, <hi>Lazarus</hi> is not only known to be sick, but dead, and stincking in the Grave, friends weep, and <hi>Jesus</hi> wept, before ever <hi>Lazarus</hi> is revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Consider that God's glorious appearance for the help of his People, is, when <hi>things come to the Mount:</hi> that is, when things are out of hope, if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:108025:76"/> do not appear; Hence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>In the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen;</hi> which makes a returning from the Mount with Sheaves; how-ever it be very melancolious to go up the Mount, yet it is very joyful to come down again, with your dead <hi>Isaac</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to life again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> He works in such a manner, that <hi>he disappoints his Peoples fears, and his Enemies hope,</hi> Isa. 35.3. His People are in great fear, his Enemies they have great hopes, but what says our Lord to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Be strong, fear not: I will come with recompence to your Enemies, but I will save you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> He works it after that rate, that <hi>in his way he makes many Heart-discoveries.</hi> And, <hi>First,</hi> He discovers the Disciples <hi>pride,</hi> that would dispute with the Master. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their <hi>ignorance,</hi> that knew not that there was no hazard, so long as Day lasted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their <hi>rashness,</hi> that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to suffer without a Call. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their <hi>disrespect and unhandsome carriage to their Master:</hi> Nay, say they, he will run himself, and us also upon hazard. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Their <hi>unbelief,</hi> both in them, and in <hi>Martha.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:108025:76"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> He does it after his own Order; That is to say, He first <hi>heals the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers that were in their Souls,</hi> and then he raises up <hi>Lazarus. Lazarus</hi> could not be the worse by his delaying to raise him, but <hi>Martha;</hi> if she had not been cured of her unbelief, she might have sustained a great prejudice. Then <hi>Christ</hi> is neer to act, when he cures the unbelief of his People, and strengthens their faith to lay hold on the promise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> He does his work, not only <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, speedily,</hi> and <hi>irresistably,</hi> but he does it so, as <hi>to leave room for your part of the work,</hi> you must roll away the stone, what-ever it be, thou must remove impediments that lie in the way; we must imploy <hi>Christ,</hi> and depend on him, but it must be in doing what he commands, though it were no more, but to roll away the stone.</p>
            <p>I come now in the last Place to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Point.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>First,</hi> By what I have said, you may be helped to try how things stands betwixt our Master, and us, and whether he hath undertaken our work in us, and for us: But how shall know this?</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:108025:77"/>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. Hath <hi>Christ sent and bespoke thee for Himself, and the message he sent,</hi> is gone to thy very heart, so that instantly thou became willing, with <hi>Rebecca,</hi> to come to Him: Can you say, that when his Law came, then you were made to run, under the sense of your own deadness, and the reviving of a body of death in thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. Then be sure the work it undertaken by Him: And thus you know was his way of old with his Church, when they cried to Him in their distress, then as an evidence that he had heard their Prayers, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to deliver them, be sent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.8, 9. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares unto them the mind and purpose of God, in order to his delivering of them; Thus he sent <hi>Moses,</hi> unto his poor People, when in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to tell them that he had undertaken the work of their Redemption: And, that he would do it with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretched Arm, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.7, 8. And the Lord said, <hi>I have surely seen the affliction of my People, and have heard their cry, by reasons of their Taskmasters, and I am come down to deliver them:</hi> But ah, where is there such a one this Day? O! for a <hi>Moses!</hi> With such a comfortable message! then might we harden our selves against
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:108025:77"/> our present sorrows, because of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Hath he <hi>Contracted and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with you about the Work of your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation; Is there a mutual pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Him and Us?</hi> If there be, then he hath undertaken the Work; have we ingaged our selves to him, then he hath ingaged himself to us; <hi>and will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his Covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and will remember the Land,</hi> Lev. 26.42. And albeit we do not keep the conditions of the Contract betwixt Him and Us; as, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59. Nevertheless says the Lord, <hi>Vers.</hi> 60. <hi>I will remember my Covenant with thee in the Days of thy Youth, and I will establish unto thee an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant; then shalt thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy Sisters, thine Elder, and thy Younger, and I will give them to thee for Daughters, but not according to thy Covenant:</hi> And so he goes on to Answer this Objection in the 62 <hi>Verse.</hi> Where <hi>Note,</hi> That as his contracting with his People, evidences his undertaking of the Work, and that he will (upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) carry it on; so, his finishing of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:108025:78"/> his Work, puts his People in the dust, and makes their mend that by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that they have ruined with their Pride; and all this our Lord does of Grace, not of Merit, which makes them the more ashamed of their former wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You may know he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a good Work in you, <hi>If he hath at any time accepted of a Sacrifice from you, and given the earnest of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto you.</hi> This is not only a great ground of confidence, as to his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, but a great blessing to thee, and to the Work, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.20. <hi>Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor his Mercy from me:</hi> When God accepts of his People's Prayers about his Work, it's a token for good; and, when he continues the Spirit of Prayer with them, for this end, that they may be his Remembrancers, then be sure he will arise, and make <hi>Jerusalem the praise of the whole Earth;</hi> but, if this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd, or, if God be angry with his People's Prayers, it is a Lamentation; And, <hi>For these things I weep, my eye, my eye runs down with tears, because relief is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:108025:78"/> gone,</hi> Lam. 1.16. Again, when God turns not away his Mercy from us, but gives unto us the earnest of his Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are helped to imploy him about his Work: It's a good token he hath undertaken it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. last. <hi>I will hide my Face no more from you; for, I have poured out my Spirit upon you:</hi> Truly, when GOD calls home his Spirit, it seems then, there is little work for him or others to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You may know that he hath undertaken the Work, <hi>By the cost and pains that every Day our Lord is at, to hold up thy goings,</hi> Psal. 17. <hi>To hold thy Soul in life, and to keep thy Feet from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved, when Men ride over your Head,</hi> Psal. 66.9, 10, &amp;c. <hi>To prove thee, and try thee as Gold is tryed, to bring thee into the Net, and bring thee out again:</hi> He is at all this cost, because he hath undertaken that great Work, <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. which is to bring thee out unto a weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Places; and, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. <hi>He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger:</hi> All this was, that he might do them good in the latter end, which was his great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking for them. Therefore I say, if you
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:108025:79"/> see him at great cost expences eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day about his Work; one Minister spends his strength about it, another is eaten up with the Zeal of his House; Take this as a sure evidence, that he hath a Work; and hath undertaken it, and will finish his Tower in due time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You may know he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by this; <hi>If his Friends and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have a mind to work:</hi> When <hi>Zion</hi>'s Dust is sweeter to all the Saints▪ than all the Powders of the Merchant, and when on this consideration they have a heart to do, what-ever their hands findes to do; <hi>Christ</hi> suffers none of his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to Work▪ but his own Work, if they do meddle with the Work of Error, he breaks their works, and if with the work of them that turn aside, there remains nothing but Repentance: But when he intends to work, then he Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, his Friends, for his work; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>The Wall goes up, and is joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> Neh. 4.6. O for more of this mind, and that, out of Love to our Work; For truly, our Work is our greatest and best wages in time.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:108025:79"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and Lastly, Then you may know that he hath undertaken the work, When <hi>you sinde him affectionately concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in what befalls the work:</hi> And, <hi>Jesus wept;</hi> oft times he weepeth alone over a dead work; And, <hi>When Jesus came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the City he wept.</hi> They were all <hi>singing,</hi> he only <hi>weeping;</hi> And must, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Jesus</hi> weep, and weep alone, and weep with the weeping Friends of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing work, and yet can you not believe, that this work is on his heart. It may be a great question, whether the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our hearts, or the deadness of his Friend <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is the greatest cause of our dear Lord's sorrow. Let us go down to the Grave, and weep with him. And so this leads me to the next word of Use.</p>
            <p>Which is to call you to weep over your dead Hearts, your dead Work, your dead Friends, and over all the Deaths that hath past on the Interests of our Lord.</p>
            <p>I have spoken a little to this before; that which now I call you to weep over shall be these.</p>
            <pb n="146" facs="tcp:108025:80"/>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I call you to weep over the <hi>distance, that you have caused by your sins.</hi> Is he not far from us? Is he not <hi>gone to his place?</hi> Hos. 5.15. Hath he not hid his Face from his Ministers and People? Is he not so far, and at such a distance, that you cannot see him? And there are none of us that can tell how long it shall be so; Is not the Comforter removed far away from us? Is not our sun gone down? What means this chilness and coldness, this darkness and drowsiness? What is the language of these long-even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shadowes of an empty profession? while the practise of Godliness is dead? Why hear I the sound of the groans of dying Graces, Gifts, and Ordinances? All this, as it is, because of our distance from him; so, it is an evidence that we are at a distance from him: And what? my Beloved, Shall Mourners go about the Streets? And, will you make glad, when all this crying is for you, because you are at a distance from your Head and Husband? Bring forth that Son of the Murderer, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin; and let it be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed before the Sun, that distance betwixt our <hi>Love</hi> and us may be removed.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:108025:80"/>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing I call you to mourn over, is, <hi>The present danger that his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular work within you, and his publick work in the World are in, and only through our means.</hi> How so? By our sins we have provoked God to <hi>destroy the covert of it,</hi> to take <hi>down the Wall</hi> that was about it: to let in <hi>wilde Boars,</hi> and to permit them to rage at their pleasures; Why, what is the cause? <hi>Israel</hi> only hath sinned, and for these sins is <hi>Zion</hi> plowed, from day to day, and is in danger of her life: What, is it so? And, shall not this make you weep in secret places, because you have indangered the Ark of God, the glory of God, the strength of the most High, the Graces of the Spirit of God, and all that is excellent and precious, and yet will you not mourn. O for mourning Women! What, must we take you to <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and there draw water, because all the Springs and Wells in Saints are run dry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I call you to mourn over the <hi>deaths that you have a hand in, by your unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, barrenness, and Atheisme.</hi> Your faith was but in danger the other day: Now, Man; thou hast kill'd it; Have you not been <hi>Christ</hi>'s death? <hi>Act.</hi> 3. You <hi>have kill'd
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108025:81"/> the Prince of Life,</hi> and that afresh, and <hi>put Him to open shame:</hi> I am sure thy Sin is worse than the sin of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him; and therefore, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. It's call'd a <hi>trampling under foot of the blood of the Covenant,</hi> and a putting him to open shame. If you had done thus to your Father and Mother, the Law would have judged you, but seeing you have done what you can <hi>to cause the work to cease;</hi> It's of your concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to mourn bitterly, as <hi>one does for his first born.</hi> And that because you have been <hi>Christ</hi>'s death, the death of the Martyrs, the death of the work of God, and you will be your own death, if you do not repent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I call to mourn over the <hi>rottenness and bad savour that hath befallen the work and People of God.</hi> Ministers they have contracted a bad savour, as if we were Rebels, and taught Rebellion, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they have contracted a bad savour, so that nothing can commend them to many, except they perfumed with the Spices of humane Inventions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he whole practise of Godliness is evil spoken of; why, what is the matter? And is there not a cause? Yea; <hi>You have made the Enemies of God to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108025:81"/> blaspheme, and because of you is the Name of God,</hi> the Ordinances of God, and the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ys of God <hi>evil spoken of daily;</hi> and truly our spot is not the least amongst them that have turned aside, that should go betwixt the living and the dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I call you to mourn, upon the <hi>account of the length of time, that things have been thus with us; Hath not the Lord hid his Face from us for a long time?</hi> Hath not his Work been in danger these many years? Have not Ordinances and Providences been dead, no ways quickning and reviving to us? And hath not a bad savour been on his Work this long time? Shall it be thus, notwithstanding of our Tears and Prayers? And shall we not shut up all with this? <hi>But thou O Lord, how long?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I call you to mourn <hi>over all the Divisions, that are amongst us, about this work,</hi> by which it falls out, that the friends of the VVork, gives the first <hi>wound</hi> to the VVork, and then others have the greater advantage in opposing of it; while thus wounded by Friends, May not all his concerns Answer these that enquire, <hi>What be these wounds,</hi> your Ministry, your Church-Ordinances,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:108025:82"/> and Government hath gotten; May they not say, <hi>these be the wounds I have received in the House of my Friends,</hi> by their divisions and dissentions, imploying their parts and gifts, against the Giver of them: O that our Head were a Fountain, to mourn and weep for this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Mourn for the <hi>hard thoughts you have had of Christ, for undertaking his Work, and carrying it on in such a way:</hi> You will be wiser than he, and holier than he, and this pleases you well; but till we have better thoughts of <hi>Christ,</hi> and learn submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his will, and better obedience by our suffering, there is small hopes of our recovery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> We have reason <hi>to lament over the opposition we have made against Him:</hi> Some of us are not only found out of our work, but are found actually ingaged, as one of his Enemies, disputing against the work, you need not prove that it's dead, nor need you tell us that our <hi>Lazarus</hi> stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor that <hi>Martha</hi> is weak in the faith, nor of our ignorance what to do for the work, or what will be done for it? we acknowledge these things; and, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108025:82"/> to weep with our Master, so we have confidence that he will step over all these discouragements, and do his work; But, what? Intends thou to be as one of them that oppresseth thy Brother <hi>Jacob?</hi> Does thou not hear them say? <hi>Loe, such an one is be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome like unto us; Shall Israel be found amongst Thieves, or must Ephraim mix him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self amongst the common People?</hi> Pray ye, lay by this weapon, dispute less, and believe more, that by faith you may have your dead restored to life again: I will tell you that all you can say by disputing, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing against <hi>Lazarus,</hi> will not alter <hi>Christ</hi>'s affection, nor his purpose concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reviving of him.</p>
            <p>Now my <hi>Third</hi> and last word of Use, I would give you, is, To call you to rejoyce upon the account of this, that <hi>Christ</hi> will finish, as he hath undertaken his work, notwithstanding of all difficulties in the way. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <hi>Be glad and rejoyce, for God will do great things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall Name <hi>Six</hi> excellent Grounds of Joy and Confidence to the People of God, about this Work.</p>
            <pb n="152" facs="tcp:108025:83"/>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> is this, <hi>That our Lord is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely concerned in his work of Grace on your Souls, to carry on and perfect it, as he hath begun it:</hi> and be sure <hi>Christ</hi> will never loose his interest; Loose who will, thou may meet with a storm, but shall never suffer shipwrack, because <hi>Christ</hi> hath a venter in the Ship, therefore it shall assuredly come safe to Shoar.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I would say to you, to make you rejoyce, is this, <hi>That Christ will welcome you at Mid-night, when you come to Him about his work:</hi> You can ask nothing but he will give it, and, if ever the Angel of the Covenant does wonderfully, it's then when his <hi>Lazarus</hi> is dead, and in the Grave, God is said to arise, and have mercy on <hi>Zion,</hi> because her time is come, wherein love can no longer restrain its self; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to come, because he will wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you with the glad tidings of this, that, <hi>His Lazarus shall rise again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Comfort your selves with this, that as <hi>Christ</hi> is most willing to take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment about his work, so in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, <hi>Nothing can discourage Him;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>distance, danger,</hi> nor <hi>deadness:</hi> Nay,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108025:83"/> though thou wer't <hi>stinking</hi> above ground, and with both hands <hi>thrusting</hi> away thy own mercy. as the Disciples did, yet he will do his work, and perfect it to his own praise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Rejoyce, because all <hi>Christ's Methods are best, and tend most to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the work, that is in his hand:</hi> Let him act, and do not hinder him by your unbelief: Let him take his own way, his own time, and use those means he pleaseth, all will help and hasten <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the Grave, and make him come forth with the greater advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Rejoyce, for God <hi>intends to make a Feast for Churls,</hi> to shame them out of-their miserable straitning of his Spirit: It shall not be the Spirit, or his Doctrine, dropping as the Dew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. But it shall be a <hi>pouring out of the Spirit,</hi> Isa. 32.15. And <hi>a plentiful rain,</hi> whereby. <hi>He will confirm his Inheritance when wearied,</hi> Psal. 68.9. <hi>Lift up your heads, for the day of your plentiful Redemption draweth neer,</hi> for he will not chide continually, he will perfect what he hath begun, and will do this with a notable advantage, to a dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> so
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108025:84"/> that all that heard of him, shall see and turn to the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and Lastly, Rejoyce, beecause, He that <hi>removeth his People's unbelief will roll away the Stone of outward difficulties, be what they will:</hi> It is a blessed token that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward impediments shall evanish, when the inward Plagues of the Heart are removed. I shall say no more, but as it's a mercy that Christ is at work, and cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in it; so then is the reviving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, when the Spirit is poured out, and these Heart-plagues cured that Professors have been tormented with, in the day of his hiding, and of his removing of the Spirit far from us. The good Lord return our Captivity, as the streams of the South.</p>

That once were revived and quickned in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; and now are fallen dead, and discouraged upon his turning away from them. 3. They are the <hi>words</hi> of such, who are very sensible of both the former two, <hi>viz.</hi> His <hi>turning away,</hi> and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108025:85"/>
               <hi>their own deadness upon his with-drawing.</hi> 4. They are the <hi>words</hi> of those that now finde, that nothing can revive them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he return to them, and graciously favour them with his Presence, as he useth to do to his Land. 5.

They are the <hi>words</hi> of a People, that do not give way to their unbelief and jealousies, they bring all their doubts and discouragements to God, and propounds the Question to him, saying, <hi>Wilt thou not revive us?</hi> and it's good when we do not give place to unbelief, nor stand to its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, especially when Clouds, and thick Darkness cover the Church of God. 9.

               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:108025:85"/> and yet confident Pleaders with God about their condition, they wrestle by Arguments, and plead powerfully with God tor his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to revive them. 10. And lastly, They are the <hi>words</hi> of such, as resolve to improve his returning, and their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving to his praise, whensoever they should enjoy it: In a word, they were Persons of a publick Spirit, and that designed the good of all the People of God; <hi>That thy People may rejoyce in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would premise these <hi>Six</hi> things, that the serious Christian should have upon his heart, when God's work within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, is very low.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They should seriously consider how matters stand between God and them, <hi>Whether things be intire or not? Whether there be a breach or not?</hi> If there <hi>be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt Him and them,</hi> that causeth distance, and that such a distance, that God will not speak to them, look on them, or have any communion or fellowship with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The People of the Lord should then seriously enquire, <hi>where is the Lord?</hi> and what way he is gone, whether he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind our Wall, or gone to his place, <hi>Job</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:108025:86"/> 23.3. <hi>O that I knew where I might find him.</hi> It's a grievous sin, when they <hi>that handle the Law, ask not for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The People of the Lord, as they should be sensible of his departure, so they should be very serious about, and much long for his return, <hi>But thou O Lord, how long? O turn Thee unto me, and have mercy upon me.</hi> Psal. 25.14 15. <hi>For I am desolate and afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The People of God should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very serious to get their hearts satisfied in this; That, while he is from them, he is for them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.10. <hi>For behold, I am for you, and I will return unto you;</hi> that is, though I be absent from you, yet I am for advancing your interest, and the interest of the Gospel, and will come home again in due time, and you shall be <hi>wrought</hi> upon both by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel, You shall be plowed and sowen.</hi> O what a comfortable word is this: I for you against all, I for you to sweeten all your bitter, and to supply all your wants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftbly,</hi> The People of God should be very serious, and sensible of the deadness and discouragement they fall under, upon his turning from them; and should be much affected with the same.</p>
            <pb n="159" facs="tcp:108025:86"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and lastly. External impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and inward indisposition to better their condition, should not only lead them into him, but should animate and encourage them the more to come to him, and to put their case and cause in his hand, <hi>Wilt thou not revive us? that thy People may rejoyce in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the words, <hi>Wilt not thou revive us?</hi> or rather wilt thou not return, and revive us, as in the original; Thus <hi>Ar. Montanus, Nonne tu converteris, vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabis nos:</hi> Wilt not thou return? and wilt nót thou revive us? <hi>Molerus</hi> translates it thus, <hi>An non tu conversus vivificabis nos:</hi> Will not thou, being turned to us, revive us? Wilt thou not turn thy self, when we cannot do it, and quicken us: It's an usual k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd of expostulation, that the Saints have used in their wrestlings under tentations, and how ever they seem sometimes to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of impatience, yet because they are mixt with faith, God is not offended with such, but rather is well-pleased therewith; as <hi>Tertull,</hi> saith, <hi>Vis haec est Deo grata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning then seemeth to be this; Thou hast been angry with us <hi>good Lord,</hi> and in thy just indignation torn us, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from us, which we humbly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:108025:87"/> Many rejoyce in it, and say, that thou not only hast done so, (and we adore and admire, because it's not worse) but they say, and make this news run thorow the Countrey, that thou wilt not return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that thou wilt not revive again (which is all our hope and confidence in our bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage;) Therefore let it not be presumption in thy poor dead and deserted Children to come, and thus expostulate with thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, that now we humbly beg a determination about from thy self; <hi>Wilt thou not return, and revive us again, that thy People may rejoyce in thee:</hi> Wilt not thou bring neer thy righteousness, even thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for <hi>Israel</hi> thy glory? Wilt not thou cause thy face to shine, that we may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? And, wilt not thou make us glad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the days wherein we have seen evil? <hi>That thy People may be glad in Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words you have these <hi>Four</hi> things to be considered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> Is their <hi>cross, God is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them,</hi> as is implyed in the words. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have their case under this cross, <hi>They are in a very dead condition,</hi> and doth not well know, if ever it shall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with them, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:108025:87"/>
               <hi>Cure,</hi> that only can heal their Disease, and that is <hi>God's returning to them, and reviving of them. Fourthly,</hi> You have their <hi>Crown,</hi> or excellent design wherewith they intend to crown all, <hi>viz. That if he will return and revive them;</hi> they will rejoyce and praise him, <hi>That thy People may rejoyce in Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> Doctrin, I draw from the words thus explained, is this.</p>
            <q>That Heirs of Glory may so provoke their God and Glory, that he may turn away from them for a time.</q>
            <p>This is that which the Prophet telleth us of, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. —<hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with Him; and if ye seek Him, he will be found of you: but if ye for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Him, he will forsake you.</hi> Hos. 5.15. I will go and return to my Place, Jer. 12.7. <hi>I have forsaken my House,</hi> viz. my Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, my People, and given all over to the will of my Enemies.</p>
            <p>I shall a little Enquire unto these two things. The <hi>First</hi> is this, To shew you <hi>what this turning away from his People is. Secondly,</hi> Why do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h our Lord thus turn from them.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First, What it is:</hi> For Answer unto this; I shall first shew you what have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:108025:88"/> been the notions of the Saints of old about it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall give you a brief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of it, which I shall endeavour to explain in all the Branches of it.</p>
            <p>To speak unto the first, which is the Saints notions about his turning from them. They are such as have been attended with much weakness and jealousie, yet they are of great use unto us. The <hi>First</hi> whereof is this, They call it a <hi>standing afar of,</hi> Psal. 10.1. Why standest thou afar off, this points out these two. The <hi>First</hi> is, That he is gone from them, like that of the Spouse, <hi>Song</hi> 5.6. <hi>My beloved is gone, is gone,</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is, That now he is at a great distance, and far away: gone to the Mountains, gone over Mountains: And, now Mountains of separation are got in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them, so that, they cannot behold him, or come nigh unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They call it a hiding of his face, Isa. 64.7. <hi>None stirreth up himself to take hold on thee, when thou hidest thy Face.</hi> They knew him as it were by Face, that is, by his Divine gracious Manifestations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which now they are deprived of; and finde he is angry, an effect whereof is the hiding of his Face, and removing of his wonted favours from them; and indeed,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:108025:88"/> this is one sad branch of his turning away from his People, when he shews them the back, but not the face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They call it a <hi>forgetting of their affliction and oppression,</hi> Psal. 44.24. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hidest thou thy Face, and forgettest our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and our oppression;</hi> not that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would attribute any such thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to him, who cannot be said, in this sense, either to forget or remember: but, that he carried himself so to them in his dispensations, as one carrieth to another that he hath forgotten; In not sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with him to his sense, and in that he doth not that which may bring them out of their present affliction; so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord! for ever:</hi> This is most bitter to the People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They call it a casting off, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60.1. <hi>O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered, or broken us, thou hast been displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> Psal. 74.1. <hi>O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever?</hi> Lam. 5.22. <hi>But thou hast ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejected us, thou art very wroth against us.</hi> This is more feared than selt. Their grounds, whereupon they draw this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, cannot bear it. But, what is wanting in the premises, is supplyed by their fears and jealousies.</p>
            <pb n="164" facs="tcp:108025:89"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and lastly, They call it a forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me,</hi> Mat. 27.46. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me:</hi> And how-ever we are not troubled when we forsake him; yet there is nothing more terrifying to the People of God, than apprehensions of his forsaking of them. They know the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Presence, the sad effects of his departure from them, and their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, in reference to both, which makes them dread the thoughts of his departure, while in mean time, they stand not in awe, to commit those sins that provoke him to forsake them. Thus much for the first thing propounded, for your better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>standing of our Lord's turning away from his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I promised to speak to, is, to give you a brief Description of this, from all their former Notions about it, which is this.</p>
            <q>God's turning from his People, is, the hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Face from his People generally, and leaving them to be exercised with great afflictions, and that for a very long time.</q>
            <p>This Description is grounded on their Notions about this dispensation, excepting
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:108025:89"/> their weaknesses and infirmities, which we are to watch against.</p>
            <p>But, for further clearing of this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I shall consider it apart, and clear it unto you.</p>
            <p>And <hi>First,</hi> I call it a <hi>hiding of God's face,</hi> which includes these <hi>Six</hi> Things in it. <hi>First,</hi> It includes the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th-holding of light and counsel, whereby his People are helped to discern them, and judgment, and what <hi>Israel</hi> should do, in reference to both: It was the commendation of <hi>Isachar,</hi> that they knew the times and seasons, and what <hi>Israel</hi> should do. Now when on the contrary me <hi>walk like blind men,</hi> Zeph. 1.17. <hi>When our Prophets also finde no Vision from the Lord,</hi> Lam. 2.9. And, <hi>when we see not our signes, neither is there any Prophet, or any other among us</hi> (pretend to what they will) <hi>that knoweth how long,</hi> Psal. 74.9. It appeareth that now the Lord is turned away from us, in whom is the Fountain of Light and Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This hiding includes the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of his nourishing and cherishing grace, whereby he cherisheth his People, as a Hen doth her Chickens, whereof you may see, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11. <hi>As an Eagle stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up her Nest, fluttereth over her young,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:108025:90"/> spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them on her Wings:</hi> so <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>The Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with him;</hi> so, <hi>Vers.</hi> 13, 14. As you may read at your leisure, when God turneth a-away, this is with-holden, and in place thereof, he sendeth on them desolating stroaks and judgments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37, 38. <hi>Behold, your House is left unto you desolate;</hi> Vers. 39. <hi>You shall not see me hence-forth till you shall say, Blessed is he that cometh to us in the Name of the Lord:</hi> And this the <hi>Second</hi> sad thing that is in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It includeth the hiding of those things from his People, that he hath been often shewing to them, as things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their peace, but then they would not see. And now, they are hid from their eyes, Luk. 19.41, 42. <hi>But now they are hid from thine eyes;</hi> she would not see when she might, and now she cannot see, though she would. This is a dreadful consideration in this case, and most true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It includeth the delivering up of a People to strong delusions of their own hearts, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.11. <hi>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lie,</hi> V. 12. <hi>That they all might be damned,</hi> Rom. 1.18, 19, 21, 24. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108025:90"/> also God gave them up to uncleanness, through the lusts of their own hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Father's Name, and ye receive me not, if another shall come in his own Name; him ye will r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hly,</hi> It includeth the delivering of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>p to Satan's tentations and delusions, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>I will go and be a living Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing in this Description, is, <hi>Leaving them to great afflictions,</hi> because as the absence of a Nurse for a time from a Child, or the letting it fall accidentally, as <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>'s Nurse did him, doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue her forsaking of the Child; but her casting it out of her Arms, as <hi>Hagar</hi> did <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and going away, that she may not see the death of the Childe: So every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of our Lord's, or sad dispensation he permits to fall out for thy exercise, doth not presently conclude, that he hath turned away, for he <hi>reproveth</hi> his People, before he <hi>forsake</hi> them, as in <hi>Saul</hi>'s case, he first reproves <hi>Saul,</hi> and then <hi>forsakes</hi> him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth <hi>Israel</hi> first, and then he with-draws, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.4.6. So <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.15. He <hi>tears,</hi> and then <hi>goeth away,</hi> or as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> observeth it. The Lord first departs from between the Cherubims, goeth to the Threshold of the Sanctuary, and from thence to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whereupon followeth great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the People of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Days of darkness, and trouble, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.7. He gives them up: And,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and last Branch of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, is this, That this is for a long time, like the Seventy Years captivity, the Four Hundred Years in <hi>Egypt;</hi> Hence you
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108025:92"/> may see, that, that which was in <hi>Joshuah</hi>'s time, upon the account of <hi>Achan</hi>'s cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, was not a turning from the Land, because it was of no continuance; seeing that this turning away, is for a long time together, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. <hi>And it came to pass while the Ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long: for it was twenty years:</hi> Hos. 3.4. <hi>For the Children of Israel shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide many days without a King, and without a Prince, and without a Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. which clearly supposeth length of time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing long in that lowe and forsaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> up in the day of indignation. I shall name but three Transgressions or four, for which God severely punisheth his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> Is <hi>Apostacie and Defection from Him, his Cause, Truths, Ordinances, Statutes
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:108025:92"/> and Judgments,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.15. (The words of the Text are these:) vers. 15. <hi>And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Statutes, and his Covenant that he made with their Fathers, and his Testimonies which he testified against them,</hi> (either by his Judgments or their own Consciences) <hi>and became vain,</hi> and vers. 16. <hi>And they left all the Commandments of the Lord their God,</hi> What, Is he yet their God? Yea; but what next. <hi>And they made themselves molt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Images, even two Calves;</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. But what cometh of this? Vers. 18. <hi>Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel:</hi> Nay sure, he will only be angry with the Calve-makers; yea, and with all them that trust in them really, or interpretatively; and that, <hi>to the removing them out of his sight:</hi> Now the case being so clear, It's but folly for Men to look for a sight of his face, till they consider this Head of guilt in this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Second</hi> Thing, is, <hi>When Men justifie themselves in their abominations,</hi> and say, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are not polluted, though they have gone after <hi>Baal,</hi> Jer. 2.23. or that they are delivered to commit all these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10. <hi>They will come to his House, and say, we are delivered to do all these abominations,</hi> or when they glory in it.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:108025:93"/>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. <hi>They glory in their shame,</hi> or with <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fool, <hi>make a mock of sin;</hi> and what a pity is it to see men befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with sin; and then when it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool'd them, it breaketh forth in a fiery flying Serpent upon them: And yet Men are so mad, that nothing can satisfie them, except wickedness go forth from them to all the Land, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Profaneness is gone forth from them to all the Land.</hi> This provoketh our Lord to turn away, and to give up with a People.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third,</hi> is, <hi>A Land's incorrigibleness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the means that he useth for their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> Jer. 8.4, 5. <hi>Shall they fall and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, are they gone back with a perpetual back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding?</hi> Shall bellows be burnt, and lead consumed? Cities laid on heaps, and the Land burnt up, and shall not the dross be purged away? <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.29, 30. <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.24, 25. <hi>Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battel:</hi> Can any be ignorant of the cause of this wrath, that readeth this Scripture? So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>In thy filthiness is lewdness, because I would have purged thee, and thou wouldst not be purged:</hi> This is their incorrigibleness, But, what follows? <hi>Thou shalt not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any more, till my fury rest upon thee:</hi> So;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:108025:93"/>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Why should you be smitten any more, for ye revolt more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and last I name, is, <hi>A Land's stupidity and senslessness under all this:</hi> they are burnt up, but they lay it not to heart; they are smitten, but they do not finde it; or, if they do, it's but as the Drunkard saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. <hi>They have smitten me, saith he, but when he awaketh, he calleth for it again.</hi> The Land perisheth for lack of knowledge; yet, who is sensible of it; a stupid uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Spirit, is that which doth highly provoke God to wrath, and incapacitateth thee to do any thing; for the preventing of it; It's beyond all question, that our carelesness and unconcernedness of Spirit as to sin, or Duty as to time or Eternity, is that which hath brought us under much trouble, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32.9, 10. which will never be removed, until the Spirit be poured out upon us, from on High, <hi>ibid. v.</hi> 15. I shall not insist any more on this Point, only seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider what I have said, and by what I have said on <hi>the</hi> first question, you may understand our condition, and God's way towards us; And by the other you may know your own Sin, and the cause of God's wrath manifested, in his turning from you.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:108025:94"/>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing that I observe, is this, <hi>That upon our Lord's turning away his Land and People, fall very dead and discouraged. Wilt thou not revive us?</hi> That imports the deadness of their case. <hi>That thy People may rejoyce in thee;</hi> This importeth the sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of it. I shall not detain you here, by telling you what things fall dead in his Land, when he removeth from it, such as these, viz. <hi>The Principles of sound Doctrine and manners die,</hi> whereupon error in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and loosness in Men's practise and conversation creep in into his Land, and pollute his Land, thereby turning Emmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els Land unto a Wilderness. <hi>The People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sick and weak,</hi> that in the enjoyment of his countenance were healthy and strong, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The whole head is sick, the whole heart is faint, and,</hi> v. 6. <hi>from the sole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises, and putrifying sores; they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oyntment: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of all his Peoples graces decay.</hi> Work is layed by, Men turn in from their labour, and the wild Beasts go forth to their Prey, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104.20. compared with 23. And it's sad, when these gray Hairs are here and there, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> knoweth it not, neither
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108025:94"/> will he understand. This death <hi>falleth on all the glory of his Land;</hi> then the glory of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is as a fading Flower, <hi>Their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as the morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it goeth away, Hos.</hi> 6.4. You may now name your Children <hi>Ichabod,</hi> saying, (to one another) <hi>The glory is departed from Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. The Peoples joy is gone when he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; Thou hast multiplied the Nation, and not increased the joy,</hi> Isa. 9.3. <hi>Joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is departed from the House of our God,</hi> Joel 1.16. Because those that were fed, are now starved, those that were healed are wounded, and those that came to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Lord, as Doves to their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, are now frighted away, with the terrible sight, and noisome stink of <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Calves, which they cannot kiss. <hi>The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Ordinances,</hi> (these blessed Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of our King of Kings) <hi>they fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der contempt and disgrace,</hi> being either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, by being rested upon, and put in the King's place, they die; or undervalued below their worth, they die, and are despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as light <hi>Manna;</hi> As every thing liveth in its own Orb, and being out of it, dieth; so these being either overvalued, or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quently out of their Orb, must die. <hi>The praises and vows that his Land
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:108025:95"/> was beautified and strengthned with, they are imprisoned,</hi> Psal. 65.1. <hi>Praise waiteth for thee in Zion, and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</hi> But, why are not the praises sung? They are imprisoned, Upon what occasion? Upon the occasion of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, and they must stay in Prison till he return: But may we not pay our vows? Not. Why? Because iniquities prevail, sinful sad courses prevail, that imprison the vow, and it must wait for him, before it can be performed.</p>
            <p>But to pass all these, as having touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Subject in my former Discourse, I shall shut up what I intend to speak of this Doctrine, In laying before you those seven things, that concur to deaden a Land once much favoured by Him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing which bringeth his Land (or a particular Member of it) under this deadness and discouragement, <hi>Is the loss of the wonted sense of the love and favour of the God of the Land:</hi> Thou hast been favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we did sensibly perceive it, but we have lost this sense, and are become as dead, because of it. Wilt not thou then revive us again? O! what a sad loss is it, when a Soul looseth the ravishing unspeakable joyes it had, in the apprehension of God's
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:108025:95"/> love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>In whom believing, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with joy unspeakable, and full of glory:</hi> There is now no shedding abroad of the love of God in the heart; the heart fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dead and cold. And is it not a death sad enough, when thou hast lost that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, abiding, perswasion of his love, and of thy being at peace with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being justified by Faith we have Peace with God.</hi> which made thee rejoyce under for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trials, with <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> chap. 3.17, 18. <hi>Though the Fig-Tree do not blossom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and glory in the God of my Salvation.</hi> This is the first thing that this dead condition of the People of God consisteth in, upon his turning from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing, wherein this Death consisteth, as it falleth on his Land, upon his removal, is, <hi>The Land's perplexing thoughts, about their wretched unkindness towards God, when he was so favourable to them.</hi> This made the Churches heart fail her, <hi>Song</hi> 5.6. <hi>When he spake my heart failed.</hi> Why failed? because of her wretched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness to Him, that was so kind to her, she lieth in bed, while he standeth at the Door; she is within, while he is without; she shamelesly shifts his call, while he most
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:108025:96"/> lovingly desireth her to open to him: And doubtless, these in my Text had perplexing thoughts of their wretched carriage in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from him, as their Prayer importeth, Vers. 4. <hi>Turn us, O God of our Salvation;</hi> Thus much for the second thing, wherein this death doth consist.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing, wherein this death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth, is, <hi>A deep sense of the justly deserved wrath of God,</hi> Psal. 88.7. <hi>Thy wroth lyeth hard upon me.</hi> Now the Land plungeth it self in the curse of the Law, and Flames of Hell; not only apprehendeth anger in God against it, but also is in great fears, that it shall be for ever, and drawn out to all Generations, as in the 5. Verse of this Psalm; and all this they apprehend without any cheering supportment from the Blood of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing, wherein this death on his Land consisteth, is, <hi>The oppressing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions they have of some temporal judgments.</hi> This is clearly imported in the word, <hi>Draw out thine anger.</hi> They know God will judge his People: And however, he will not make an utter end of them, yet he will not leave them altogether unpunished. They know, <hi>That judgment beginneth at the House of God.</hi> This, together with the thoughts of their former undutiful carriage, causeth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108025:96"/> trembling to take hold of them, for fear of his judgments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.120. Sometimes they fear to be given up of God, to fall in some gross sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.8. And so to be made the scorn of the foolish. Sometimes again they fear, that God will suddenly strike at, and take them away in his anger. As there, <hi>Take me not away in thine anger.</hi> Sometimes they think they shall raise a storm, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, either in the Family-Church, or Nation, wherein they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; now, what can be sader, then for one to be under such apprehensions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing, wherein this Death on his Land consisteth, is, <hi>Prevailing fears of being utterly rejected:</hi> Vers. 5. Wilt thou be angry <hi>for ever?</hi> Wilt thou not revive us again? speaketh out their fear and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, as you shall hear in its proper place; So <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.4. <hi>I said I am cast out of thy sight,</hi> Psal. 88.4. <hi>I am counted with them that go down unto the Pit:</hi> Psal. 74.1. <hi>O God thou hast cast us off:</hi> And what can be more bitter than death, if this be not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> thing, wherein this death on the Land consisteth, is, <hi>The dreadful arrows that he shooteth at us, by his surprizing, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Providences;</hi> All which (as we judge) are against us, <hi>Job</hi> 17.8. By his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108025:97"/> sharp reproofs, hewing us to pieces, and causing our beauty to fade like a Moth: <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.13. And drinking up the Spirits of his People, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4. So that there is no soundness in their heart or flesh, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.3.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> and last thing, wherein this Death consisteth, is, <hi>The Land's unspirited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and disability, either to do or suffer:</hi> There is no Spirit here, they cannot help themselves, revived they must be, but they cannot do it, so <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>I am not able to look up.— Therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> And indeed, as the Kingdom becometh <hi>base</hi> when he removeth; so it's <hi>activity</hi> is gone, when he is gone, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.7. None <hi>calleth on the Lord,</hi> none <hi>stirreth up himself to take hold on thee:</hi> Why? <hi>For thou hast hid thy Face from us:</hi> We may then stumble and stagger like a drunken Man, we may then make long shadows, but we are wearied and cannot work, slothful and cannot watch, unstable and cannot suffer. Thus much for the Death that falleth on the Land upon our Lord's removing from it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Doctrine, that I draw from the words, is this, <hi>That while God is angry and removed from his People, there is no help nor relief for them against the deadness of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108025:97"/> their present condition.</hi> Wilt not thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and revive us, telleth us, that when God denieth to revive, or with-draweth his concurrence from means ordained to life, there can be no reviving. This you may see the Church of God lamenting over, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.16. <hi>For these things I weep, mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,</hi> (why what is the cause of her weeping?) <hi>because the Comforter that should relieve my Soul is far from me. q. d.</hi> Tentations assault me, and there is no relief for me against them. Corruption springeth up in me, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for me. Grace faileth in me, and in my Children, and there is no relief for my soul. I faint in my sighing, and there is no relief for preventing it, or recovering me out of it. The Crown hath fallen from my Head, the glory is departed; the day goeth away; a dark Cloud of his anger covereth me, and my Children are carried unto Captivity, yet there is no relief; Why? because the Comforter, that relieveth my Soul, is far away: He is not gone altogether from me, but is far away from me, and is at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and so long as it is thus, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e is no relief for my Soul.</p>
            <p>What! No relief? Is there none in God? Yea, but none for me. Why so? 1. <hi>Because
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108025:98"/> he is angry, and fights against me,</hi> Isa. 63.10. <hi>Therefore was He turned to be their Enemy, and He fought against them.</hi> O Lamentable! What? not only turned far from thee, but also turned to be thy Enemy, and an enemy fighting against thee, then thou can have no relief from him. 2. <hi>Because iniquity hath separated betwixt Him and us,</hi> Isa. 59.2. <hi>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sin hath hid his face from you, that He will not hear.</hi> Then he can revive you; yea, his hand is not shortned, but it can save; nor is his Ear heavy, but it can hear; but my iniquity hath separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between him and me, <hi>and He will not hear:</hi> There is no relief then here, till Sin be removed, and wrath be appeased. 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as He hath called an Assembly against me, to crush my young Men, so the Lord hath dilivered me into their Hands, from whom I am not able to rise up,</hi> Lam. 1.15. compared with the 14. vers. And thus it must be, because he hath called and commanded them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 47.7. <hi>How can it be quiet, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord hath given it a charge,</hi> against us, <hi>there hath He appointed it.</hi> Then you see, when he is angry and turned away, There is no reviving for the dead, on this hand all refuge faileth; <hi>From above hath
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108025:98"/> He sent Fire into my Bones,</hi> Lam. 1.13.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Secondly</hi> cannot Angels, thats he hath made ministring Spirits, for the relief of his Saints, help us in this case? <hi>A.</hi> There is no reviving, or relief to be had here ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For 1. All the Angels that we can expect, while he is angry and turned away; are bad ones, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.49. <hi>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels among them.</hi> 2. Suppose he would send good Angels, yet these could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive you, when he hath turned from you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> sympathy, signifieth little to a soul, thirsting after Christ, till Christ himself speak. 3. Suppose they could do any thing in this case, they would not. Might they not say to thee, as the Devil said to <hi>Saul? Saul</hi> cometh to him, (it's true he sought for <hi>Samuel</hi>) and saith, <hi>The Philistins are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and God hath forsaken me.</hi> What is the Answer? <hi>Seeing God hath forsaken thee, why comest thou to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Cannot one in this case finde relief at home, in their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>A.</hi> None at all. For, 1. Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:108025:99"/> (as God's Deputy) accuseth thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>And their thoughts, the mean while, accusing, or else excusing one another:</hi> Now when Conscience doth challenge, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, or refreshing canst thou finde from it. 2. Because it not only challengeth, but setteth all thy-sins (with their several aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations) <hi>in order before thee:</hi> Psal. 50.21. I will set them in order before thee; and what relief can thou find, when these troops do inviron thee. 3. <hi>Because it is as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand witnesses against thee,</hi> Rom. 2.15. <hi>Their Conscience witnessing,</hi> thou cannot deny the fact, neither shall thy pleading <hi>not guilty,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.23. relieve thee: <hi>For thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is marked before me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>v.</hi> 22. and Conscience, it saith, thy backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings they reprove thee; so that as yet thou can have no help in this case from Conscience. 4. Because Conscience <hi>doth actually judge and condemn thee;</hi> and must do so of necessity: What relief then can you promise to your selves from Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? It must proceed-according to Law, which judgeth and condemneth thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast rebelled against it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Cannot one in this case finde relief from Ordinances? <hi>A.</hi> Not at all. Why so? <hi>A.</hi> Because he is gone.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:108025:99"/> Why, what then? Cannot they help us, when he is turned from us? Not: How so Because, when he is turned from his People, then the Life and Power of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances is gone, the Word is but Wind, all is but an empty, weak, and insignificant report, for the Arm of the Lord is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. And how can that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and quicken thee, that hath no life in it self. 2. Upon his turning away, there are dark Clouds that fill the Sanctuary; so that there is nothing but darkness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of divination, and stumbling an noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, as in the night. <hi>Thy Prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee, and they have not discovered thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity: but have seen for thee false bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and causes of banishment,</hi> Lam. 2.14. Neither can thou expect any relief here, when he is turned out of his House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because when God is wrath with his People, if they do yet enjoy the Ordinances, he giveth commission to them in his righteous judgments, to make Ears heavy, and hearts fat, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Make the Heart of this People fat, and make their Ears heavy, and shut their Eyes.</hi> O! how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is this, neither here then canst thou finde any reviving.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:108025:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because when God is wroth, and turneth away, he sometimes turneth out his People from the enjoyment of these Ordinances, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74 6. <hi>But now they break down the carved Work.</hi> Vers. 9. <hi>We see not our signs, there is no more any Prophet that can tell us how long.</hi> Now suppose those could revive them, when enjoyed, yet now when they are revived of them, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief can they expect from them?</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I have Goods layed up for many Years, necessity nor poverty shall not pinch me, I shall finde reviving here. <hi>A.</hi> Thou cannot; For, 1. In the day of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he may take thee away in his wrath, Job 36.18. <hi>Because there is wrath, beware least he take thee away with his stroke, then a great ransome cannot deliver thee.</hi> These then, whose shall they be? 2. Thou may drink thy Wine in Bowles, yet this cannot help thee, for thy Cup is a Cup of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and one blow shall break it, as a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Vessels, and make it fall out of thy hand, thy Bread is by weight, and thy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by measure, and thou eatest with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and trembling, thy Soul refuseth every pleasant food. How canst thou be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by these?</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:108025:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Thy close Places shall not relieve thee, Psal. 18.45. <hi>The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid, out of their close Places.</hi> When he shall say this one word, <hi>Adam where art thou?</hi> All the Bushes shall give thee up to the hands of a living God.</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>Sixthly,</hi> can crosses revive you these are all killing in their own nature; and it is judgment, and burning with the Spirit, that maketh these purging, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.4. when the <hi>Lord shall have washed away the filth of the Daughters of Zion, by the Spirit of judgment, and by the Spirit of burning.</hi> It's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of burning, and that purgeth away the cross.</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>Lastly,</hi> can Magistrates or Ministers relieve you. For, 1. Our hypocrisie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh the Lord to do a marvelous thing on them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.13, 14. <hi>Their heart is far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the Precepts of Men:</hi> What followeth on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. When a People feareth not God, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est of Magistrates, and Ministers can do
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108025:101"/> them no good, <hi>Hos.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Because we feared not the Lord, what then should a King do to us.</hi> It were good we had serious thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this thing, that thereupon being hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our sin, he may exalt us in due time. Thus much for clearing to you my Third Doctrine, propounded to you from the words.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Thing I observe, is, their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, and fear; That he will not return and revive them 3. an ordinary infirmity, the People of God fall in, when he hideth his Face from them, they think they shall see Him no more.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine is this, <hi>That when God turneth away from his People, and stayeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a long time; they fall usually under a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and fear, that He will no more return to them, or revive them,</hi> Psal. 77.7. <hi>Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will He be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable no more?</hi> v. 8. <hi>Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth His mercy fail for ever more?</hi> So vers. 9. <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his tender mercies?</hi> This is our infirmity.</p>
            <p>There are these <hi>Eight</hi> things that cause the People of God thus apprehend. The <hi>First</hi> thing that makes them judge thus, is, <hi>The sensible with-drawings of the good Spirit
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:108025:101"/> of Promise from them,</hi> Lam. 1.16. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.22. The Spirit is far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.16. They do conclude, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.22. that he had utterly rejected them. This is not ground sufficient to prove, that he had done so, for he doth pour out, or with-draw his Spirit, as he pleaseth. <hi>The Wind bloweth where it listeth,</hi> and it is no argument of his <hi>rejecting a People,</hi> when he doth not take his Holy Spirit away from them, as <hi>David</hi> feared he would do, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. Though he be pleased to <hi>restrain</hi> the influences thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing that make the People of God so jealous and doubtful in this case, is, His <hi>looking on,</hi> when not only his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies break <hi>the carved work,</hi> but destroy the Men, that <hi>are more upright than themselves,</hi> Psal. 74.1. Then they apprehend casting off <hi>for ever: O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever.</hi> The Reason of their judging thus, you have <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. <hi>But now they break-down the carved work.</hi> v. 7. <hi>They have cast Fire into thy Sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore <hi>v.</hi> 11. they say, <hi>Why with holdest thou thine hand? Pinck it out of thy bosome:</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Arise O God, plead thine own cause.</hi> Having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come jealousie, they mind their duty, and plead with God about their cause and his.</p>
            <pb n="190" facs="tcp:108025:102"/>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing that maketh the People of God judge and fear thus, is <hi>The many sad dispensations he exerciseth them with;</hi> whereby he scattereth them, <hi>maketh the Earth to tremble, breaketh it, and maketh his People to drink the Wine of astonishment,</hi> Psal. 60.1. <hi>O God, thou hast cast us off,</hi> Why so? <hi>thou hast scattered us,</hi> v. 1. and v. 3. <hi>thou hast shewed thy People hard things:</hi> It's true, he may <hi>scatter</hi> his People, and <hi>shew</hi> them hard things, and yet not cast them off; but it is as true, that the Lord's People do judge thus, when they are under such dark and discouraging dispe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sations, though it be their infirmity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.10.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing that make the People of God judg thus, is, <hi>God's blasting all their counsels, and the means used by them, for their own relief out of their troubles.</hi> Psal. 13.1. <hi>They judge that he hath forgotten them for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> The Reason is subjoyned in the 2d Vers. <hi>I take counsel in my Soul, having sorrow in my heart daily. q. d.</hi> All my purposes are broke off, they but increase my fear and affliction; and yet this is no ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus, because he crosseth your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which passeth with you for graw counsel.</p>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:108025:102"/>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing that nourisheth and streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hneth this jealousie, is, <hi>His continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in hiding from us.</hi> It's for so long a time, that we think, it will never be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; <hi>Wilt thou draw forth thine anger to all Generations to the Winter is past, and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is come, and yet we are not saved.</hi> He can keep thee <hi>Seventy</hi> Years in the <hi>Babilonish</hi> Furnace, and yet not reject thee: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he continue long or short, it is for thy advantage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth,</hi> is <hi>The manifold disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that God in his holy Providence exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth them with,</hi> Jer. 8.15. <hi>We looked for peace, but no good come; and for a time of health, and behold troubles</hi> this made their heart to faint in them, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. <hi>When I would comfort my self against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.</hi> So Isa. 26.17, 18. <hi>We have been with Child, we have been in pain, we have, as it were, brought forth Wind, we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth.</hi> Upon this, they fall dead, and discouraged, and <hi>v.</hi> 19. God giveth them a promise for their encouragement. <hi>Thy dead Men shall live,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>A growing distance, between God and them,</hi> together with the disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, or removal of his mercy and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:108025:103"/> from them, makes them judg thus; Psal. 10.1. <hi>Thou standest afar off;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou hidest thy Face from us. He may stand afar off, and yet shew you his Face, though thou cannot discern it, so distinctly at a distance; the hiding of his mercy and salvation from thee, may make thee say, <hi>Wilt thou not return and revive us?</hi> And yet thy conclusion is false, which is this, therefore he will not revive us again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> and Lastly, <hi>Their ignorance of, or not making use, of the Covenant of Grace, made them thus jealous;</hi> for it is inconsistent with the ends and promises of the new Covenant, to reject utterly, one that hath been taken into Covenant with God; <hi>I will not break my Covenant, nor alter the thing that hath gone out of my mouth,</hi> Psal. 89.34. Yet when they forget the Covenant, then they say, <hi>Vers.</hi> 38. <hi>But thou hast cast us off, and abhorred us.</hi> I might here speak fully to the weakness of these grounds of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and the non-concludency of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and Caution you against misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving fear, and cruel jealousie, but finding my Work would be tedious, and studying brevity, I shall pass these things. Thus much for the Fourth Point of Doctrine, which was this, That when God turneth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:108025:103"/> away from his People, and stayeth away a long time; they fall usually under great jealousie and fear, that he will no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them, or revive them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Thing I observe in this Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation, is, Faith's <hi>check,</hi> that it giveth to this jealousie, Faith will not stand to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies <hi>verdict.</hi> It is so contradicting to the Covenant, and God's promises therein to his People, and so contrary to Faith's verdict in the case, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.2. <hi>I have said mercy shall be built up for ever;</hi> and if so, all is well enough; God is building up mercy by all these acts of judgment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he chastiseth his People, yet this doth not satisfie, till they bring the cause to him, that they may get his verdict about it. Wilt not thou revive us? <hi>q. d.</hi> Enemies say, thou hast forsaken us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71.11. <hi>God hath forsaken him, persecute and take him.</hi> But, wilt not thou return to us again, and revive us? Our discouraged, and faint hearts say, thou wilt not revive us, yet Lord, we wait till we hear what thou wilt say, that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Peace to thy People. Dispensations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed seem to say, thou hast cast us off, but be it so, (for which we are heartily sorry) yet this is not the question, for the question is this, <hi>Wilt thou not revive us again?</hi> Sense
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:108025:104"/> saith, How shall the dead be restored to life again? But, we wave that, and come to thee for reviving, leaving the manner and method of it, the <hi>quomodo</hi> and <hi>quando</hi> of it to thee; And, if thou wilt but say thou wilt revive us: Then, 1. We shall not much care, what growing <hi>difficulties, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, desertions, disorders,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, or our Enemies</hi> say to the contrary. 2. If thou wilt say, that thou wilt revive us, we will make thy <hi>testimony</hi> a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our <hi>Creed,</hi> and will hold by it, till thou actually <hi>return</hi> and <hi>revive</hi> us; and <hi>though the Vision should yet be for an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, yet we will wait for it.</hi> 3. If thou wilt say thus to us, that thou wilt revive us, then we will make all our, discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tentations say the same; and so, <hi>out of these Eaters we shall get meat:</hi> we shall make them speak the language of the promise, that formerly did plead for, and increased our jealousie. 4. If thou revive us, then thou wilt return, for we cannot be revived, till thou return; no difficulty shall be able to stand in thy way, no <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>communion</hi> with thy self, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to our reviving, shall be with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; no <hi>driness, scattering,</hi> or present <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or <hi>indisposition</hi> in the dry bones, shall
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:108025:104"/> hinder their reviving, if thou wilt revive us: if thou return and revive, the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> shall be turned into a <hi>fruitful Field.</hi> 5. If thou wilt revive us, we shall be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to one another, and instead of being discouraging, and insnaring to others, we shall be up-stirring and quickning unto them, and our selves also. And truly, until our God return, and revive, though we would, yet we cannot do any thing effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for your reviving; though it's good for us always to be found in our duty. 6. If thou wilt return and revive us, then we will make publick intimation of it to all our Enemies, that say, Where is now your God? We will Answer, He is in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and doth what-ever he pleaseth, and is returning to revive us, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and be glad in him. 7. If thou wilt return and revive us, we will not fear Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, we will look danger and death in the face with a displayed Banner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 60.4. <hi>Yet thou hast given a Banner to thy People, that it may be displayed, because of the truth:</hi> we will step over all that standeth in the way of a returning Ark, or of the reviving his People longeth so much for. 8. If thou say thou wilt return and revive, this will encourage us heartily to invite thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:108025:105"/> as now at this present time we do invite thee, for we would not be last in calling home the King to his own Court again. 9. Take Faith's verdict in this <hi>viz.</hi> It maketh them speak thus, I cannot, nor dare not promise to my self, or to others, any thing about these dry bones, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not revive them, none but God can, and that when there is nothing but death and confusion in the case. 10. and lastly, If thou say thou wilt revive us, I shall hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fo th not only judge it best, to come to thee now, but be the more encouraged for the future, to come with all my complaints and grievances, though death were in the case. <hi>Wilt thou not revive us again?</hi> Thus much for the first thing propounded, which holdeth out Faith's victory over jealousie, and teacheth us to bring all our cases to Him, that he may shew us his purpose and thoughts about them, and make us hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquiess therein, as knowing that his judgment is the rest of his People, be the judgment of others what it will.</p>
            <p>Thus having spoken to the words in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I shall endeavour now to consider them more particularly, as they are in my Text. In doing of which, I shall first speak
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:108025:105"/> unto this, <hi>That there is such a thing as revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Covenant, between God and his People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the People of God do often want it, and do much stand in need of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the restoring of a People to a flourishing and lively condition, is a a very hard and difficult thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here it's call'd a <hi>reviving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y,</hi> That notwithstanding of its difficulty, yet in all our approaches to God upon all occasions, we should pursue it say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Wilt thou not revive us again?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That upon his return, his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are actually revived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That this reviving doth beget much joy, and gladness in the hearts of the People of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and Lastly, That thiS joy thus begotten in their hearts, by his return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to, and reviving of them, is in himself; and that which the People of God should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press with a thankful voice, upon his retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to, and reviving of his praise.</p>
            <p>In speaking unto these Seven Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; I shall (for brevity's sake) <hi>First</hi> clear them to you, one by one, and then make Application of them all together, and so
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:108025:106"/> shut up this Piece of Service, that I have adventured on, meerly out of love to his dead Work, and out of hope that he will revive it again, that we may live in his sight.</p>
            <p>I come therefore unto the <hi>First</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which is this, <hi>That there is such a thing as reviving in this new Covenant, which is between God, and his People, in a Mediator.</hi> Whereas the old Covenant of wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s did shut the Door, from ever escaping, in that it was weak through the Flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. This Covenant of Grace openeth a Door of escaping by Jesus Christ, who was sent <hi>in the likeness of sinful Flesh, to condemn sin in the Flesh,</hi> ibid. He it is that is <hi>anointed to preach glad tidings to the meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclame Liberty to the Prisoners, and the opening of the Prison to them that are bound,</hi> Isa. 61.1. <hi>To comfort all that mourn, to give them beauty for ashes, the oyl of joy for mourning, the Garments of praise for the Spirit of Heaviness,</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this further unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is quickning and reviving in this Covenant: I shall propound these <hi>Nine</hi> things, to be considered by you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing to be consider'd, for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, is this, <hi>That it hath pleased the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:108025:106"/> Father, that in Him</hi> (who is the propounded match for Souls in this Covenant) <hi>all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. &amp; 2.9. So that whatever is requisit and necessary for revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the body, is in the head; yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is or what-ever he hath; whatever he hath done, is doing, or will do, all is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving unto his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider, as he is full of grace and truth, <hi>So there is an union between Him, and his People, by vertue of which they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that virtue and life, that is in Him, for reviving of them,</hi> Joh. 15.1, 2. <hi>Every branch in me;</hi> there is their Union, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulness we receive, even grace for grace.</hi> There is the communication of what he hath on his part, and our participation of it, upon our part, And what can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving? if Grace be not, especially in its abundance, <hi>Grace for grace;</hi> or in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant supplies, <hi>Grace for grace;</hi> or as it holdeth forth the giving of one grace to help us to improve another; <hi>For of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness have we received, and grace for grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider, that in case we sin in refusing, or abusing this grace that is in Him; then know, <hi>that this Covenant admits of repentance:</hi> which the other Covenant of Works doth reject. Though thou hast
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:108025:107"/> played the Fool, yet there is place for <hi>after wit</hi> here; If thou turn, he will repent of the evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thine iniquity,</hi> Act. 2.38. <hi>Repent.</hi> — For the promise is to you, and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to as many as God shall Call. And, what can be more reviving, than the consideration of this? as you may see in the poor Prodigal, when he apprehended that there was place for repentance, he is presently revived, and resolveth on duty; <hi>I will go to my Father, and say, I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. This likewise is supposed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Psal. 32.5. I said I would confess my sin, and thou forgavest the iniquity thereof, <hi>v.</hi> 6. For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee. This third thing then that is in this Covenant, is very reviving and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider this, that what-ever is commanded in a way of duty, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to his People, He commandeth us to love him; he hath promised to circumcise our hearts to love him; he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to sanctifie him in our hearts, and make him our fear, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.13. He hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to put his fear in our hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. He hath commanded us to call on him in the day of our trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. He
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108025:107"/> hath promised we shall do it, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.15. <hi>In their affliction they shall seek me early.</hi> He hath call'd me to believe in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that you believe in his Son:</hi> He hath promised that I shall believe. The Gentiles shall trust in him. <hi>To it shall the Gentiles seek, and his rest shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> Isa. 11.10. He commandeth us to make us a new heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. This he promiseth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. A new heart will I give you; so that it is clear, that which is call'd for from us by the Precept, is given to us in the Promise; And, is not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and comforting to the People of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Consider this, <hi>There is order in the Covenant:</hi> and this is very reviving to consider, that the Promise cometh first, then the Command: First grace, and then glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; first weeping, and then joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; first sowing in tears, and then reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in joy; first loosers for Christ, and then gainers of an hundred fold; first kill'd, and next quickned; there is not a cross can come on his People, but according to the Covenants Order: It can stay no longer than the Order bears: It can touch no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but such as it hath an Order for: Good order is the Life, either of Societies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108025:108"/> or Armies, and if so, then there must be reviving, and encouragement there, where there is so comely an order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Consider this, there is <hi>suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in all the things; God hath promised to the case, and condition of his People,</hi> be it half dead, or whole dead, be it sick, weak, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, faint or feeble, all is alike to our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted God, Think you it strange that God should raise the dead, or relieve those that are ready to perish? If thou be in hazard of perishing in thy uncleanness, he hath water to wash and purge thee; if dead, he hath water of life to quicken and revive thee; if sick, he hath Physick for thee; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> discouraged, he hath Wine of Consolation to comfort and strengthen thee; if blinde, there are eyes for the blind; if pursued, there is a strong hold for thee to turn into▪ Now, what can be more reviving than this to have all, and that so suitable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent case, and cross of every Soul: Mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> these things are contained, and that is in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Consider this, and you shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> finde, that there is reviving in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nant, <hi>viz.) the firmness and sureness of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

You may break the Peace you have in your own Conscience, but the Peace that is betwixt God and you, is on better Foundations; It's sure, there may be Fatherly anger, which may frighten and terrifie from sin, but he will never take his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat performeth all things for thee, shall do it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.3. The promise is sure, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat particularly, which promiseth you the Cross: The mercies of <hi>David</hi>'s House are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Consider this, That there is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

There is freedome and security against the Son of mischief, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. The Foe shall not exact upon him, nor shall the Son of mischief wrong him, considering that all works together for good, to them that feares him. There is security from the Spiritual Plagues of the times, so that how-ever they may touch thee, and make the Priest pronounce thee unclean, yet thou shalt not die of that Disease, smitten thou may be, but die thou must not, in thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and impenitency: And, is there no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> and lastly, To convince you of this, that we stand in need of quickning; <hi>Consider what one Day ye shall be when-ever with the Lord,</hi> when <hi>deaths, dangers,</hi> the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>symptoms, effects</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of all, shall evanish as the smoke, and shall be no more a trouble to thee. Thou that art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a stranger to the high praises of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s God, in your Family and Closet, know, thou must sing over his sweet Hallelujahs, thou that now seldome approach his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, remember thou must be ever with him, thou that contenteth thy self with thy small measures, remember you must be full
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:108025:113"/> of God, full of Life, all Life, all Joy, all Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doth not this say, you stand in need of reviving.</p>
            <p>I have not been at all this pains, as one ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this, That this Point is conceded unto, by all the People of God, <hi>that they need reviving;</hi> And, if so, you may say, I might have spared this cost here, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed it else-where; And indeed, I grant it is so confest by most part: But my design is to imprint this deeper on the heart with this Eight fold Impression, I have laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. 2. It's to give you a view of it, in these distinct Considerations, that your eye may the more affect your heart. And, 3. For your satisfaction, I tell you, that if this parcel of my commodities, I have sent to you by this Bearer, do not please you, and are found useless, then at my cost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it again; It's probable others will eat the Grass, that you tread under Foot, and drink the Water, as Wine, that you fowl with your Feet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.18, 19. Thus much for the Second Thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> That the People of God usually stand in great need of reviving.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing that falleth next, under our Consideration, is this, <hi>That the restoring of a People</hi> (brought low for their iniquity)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:108025:114"/>
               <hi>to a flourishing and lively condition, is a very hard and difficult thing.</hi> It's an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for <hi>Israel</hi> to destroy himself, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.9. But he will find it a harder work to help himself out of this Death and Grave, he hath brought himself unto; You may soon provoke God, but it's not so easie to stay the Plague that breaketh out on thee, for provoking the most High; any can do the one, but it's God only out of his free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace in Jesus Christ, that can do the other.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this to you, that this is a very hard and difficult work, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to ponder in an even Ballance these <hi>Five</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Consider, <hi>What the Spirit of God in the Scripture compareth it unto, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions he useth in speaking of it.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth it to the Work of Creation, and speaketh so of it. <hi>I create the Fruit of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thing? Who hath seen such things? Shall the Earth he made to bring forth in one Day? or shall a Nation be born at once? For as soon as Zion travelled, she brought forth her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Isa.</hi> 66.8. <hi>Shall the dead praise thee,

Lord, thou knowest.</hi> And, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed none can Answer this Question, but He that doth propound it. <hi>The Dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of Man, and they that hear shall live,</hi> Joh. 5.25. Doth not all these expressions prove, that it's a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing to revive a Church, a Nation, or a particular Soul, when dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Thing, I call you to consider, for proving of the difficulty of this work, is this, <hi>That our Lord speaketh so of it, of purpose to convince us of the difficulty of it:</hi> Yea, he insinuates as much, as if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self were straitned with this case, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. <hi>But I said,</hi> (This is an Objection made by <hi>God</hi> himself against the former promises) <hi>how shall I put thee among the Children, and give thee a pleasant Land, a good Heritage of the Hosts of Nations. q. d.</hi> How shall I put thee, who hast fallen from thy first love, who hast forsaken me, the Fountain of living Water; who art polluted, and yet you will not acknowledge it; that hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten me, and hast said thou will come no more to me, whose confidences I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and who will not say <hi>my Father,</hi> thou
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:108025:115"/> art the God of my Youth: That will not so much as acknowledge your iniquity. How shall I put such among the Children, or give you a pleasant Land, so <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.4. O <hi>Ephraim,</hi> what shall I do unto thee! O <hi>Judah,</hi> what shall I do unto thee, all this speaketh out the difficulty of the case, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.8. How shall I give thee up <hi>Ephraim?</hi> How shall I deliver thee, <hi>Israel?</hi> Thus much for the Second Thing, for proving the difficulty of recovering, or reviving a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when brought low.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Thing, that proveth the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it, is taken <hi>from the Persons imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it, the whole blessed Trinity is at work in this affair.</hi> The Father he giveth and draweth to the Son, <hi>all that the Father giveth me shall come to me,</hi> Joh. 6.37. <hi>No Man can come to me except the Father draw him,</hi> v. 44. Jesus Christ the second Person in the Trinity, he is imployed about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of a Soul, Zech. 1.12. <hi>Then the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord of Hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem, and on the Cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation, these three-score and ten years,</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Awake O Sword against my Shepherd, and against the Man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of Hosts.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:108025:115"/> Christ</hi> must suffer, rise again, and live for ever to intercede for his People, that they may be restored to life, and made to walk in his Paths. Tne Spirit, the third Person in the glorious Trinity, he is imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this work, and is sent forth by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Son, to illuminate, convince, convert, build up, and establish poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in a revived state and condition, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. All the Ordinances of the House of God, all the Providences wherewith he executeth his Word, all the Crosses and Comforts that are in the new Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, they are imployed about the restoring of a lapsed Church, or a backsliden Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stian▪ Therefore I say, restoring or reviving of his People, when low, is a very hard thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing, I call you to consider, for clearing of this, That his People's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation, is a very hard Work: 'Tis this, <hi>The improbability of the thing it self:</hi> Shall a Nation be brought forth at once? Can <hi>these dry Bones live?</hi> speaketh out the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability of the thing, a profane Lord, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. On whose hand the King lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, answered the Man of God, and said, <hi>If the Lord would make Windows in Heaven, might this thing be?</hi> v. 2. Yea, I tell thee,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:108025:116"/> this thing may be done, and not a Window opened: but, such a profane Atheist, as thou art, shall not taste thereof, but shall be trod upon, till he die.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and last thing, I would have you to consider, for clearing the difficulty of the Work, and to prove that it's a hard Work: is, <hi>The opposition that is made to it;</hi> we hinder it our selves, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.1. <hi>When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim was discovered,</hi> Isa. 57. <hi>I smote him, yet he walked on the more frowardly,</hi> he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and hindred his own cure. Then there is much opposition from Satan, the World, and from one another. Now where a work meeteth with great opposition, then, and in that case, you may be sure it shall prove a hard matter to get it restored, to what it was, or revived again. I only observe this for these <hi>Four</hi> ends.</p>
            <p>First, To tell you, that it is God only that can revive and restore his People to life again. He only hath <hi>life in himself,</hi> and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> himself, <hi>he is life,</hi> he is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of it; and, therefore there is abundance of it in Him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>With thee is the Fountain of life.</hi> He is an <hi>overflowing Fountain,</hi> Life floweth out of Him more easily, than water
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:108025:116"/> floweth out of a Fountain; Life in him is a <hi>communicable</hi> thing, that he giveth to his People: Let men communicate what they will, they cannot communicate their life, except they presently die, but it's not so here. This is not only communicable, but our God <hi>effectually</hi> applyeth this, for the reviving of his Land, so that by one touch the Lord is revived, and as it is said, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.21. of the Man, that they were bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that, so <hi>soon as he touched the Bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his Feet.</hi> So may I say of his Land and People, so soon as he but toucheth them, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and do stand up in his sight, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.2. <hi>After two days, he will revive us, and we shall live in his sight.</hi> Yea more, if there be any <hi>means,</hi> that prove effectual for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a perishing Land: It's he alone that maketh the same <hi>effectual,</hi> by his <hi>blessing</hi> on them, and his <hi>revealed Arm</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe, and take notice of the difficulty of this Work; to tell you that it's more than time ye were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; your Work is <hi>great,</hi> your time is <hi>short,</hi> your Day <hi>goeth</hi> away: The Spirit that is your Co-worker, and strengthens you to work, is <hi>far away;</hi> Will you not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:108025:117"/> then, <hi>up,</hi> and to it: <hi>Rise, and be doing, and the Lord shall be with you.</hi> It's true, you may meet with difficulties in Praying, watching, and waiting for the Lord, but your greatest difficulty is overcome, when you are risen up out of your security, and made willing to undergo what-ever this difficult work may necessarily call you to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Hence see, what a great mercy it is to be revived; and how much of <hi>God</hi> is to be seen in it; How should thou mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his reviving, in the midst of the years? though for the present thou cannot; yea, must not be altogether delivered, till the Forty Days come, that is appointed for the setting of a tossed Ark on Mount <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and lastly, Hence you may see what great Reason you have to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst every thing, that is killing and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to thee, or the Land; Ye may soon provoke the Lord to smite you, and to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get it so easily repaired again: And therefore, I would entreat you to watch and pray, least at any time you make way to his wrath, then a great Ransome cannot redeem you. Thus much for the <hi>Third</hi>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:108025:117"/> Thing propounded, to be spoken to, which is to shew you how hard a matter it is, to restore a Land, or Person, to wonted favour, that hath lost it by its ingratitude, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sins.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> Thing, I propounded to speak to, is this, <hi>That the People of God, in all their approaches to God, should much press for, and seek after a reviving, Wilt thou not revive us again? Reviving</hi> is that which is most on their heart, and most in their design; Now, when they finde how low they are brought for their iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Revive thy Work in the midst of the years,</hi> Psal. 80.18.<hi>Quicken us,</hi> Psal. 119.25 <hi>Quicken me according to thy Word,</hi> vers. 88. <hi>Quicken me after thy loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> vers. 149. <hi>Quicken me according to thy judgment,</hi> Psal. 143.11. <hi>Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall, for clearing and proving of this, <hi>viz.</hi> (that the People of God, when low, and under many sad Dispensations, should pursue reviving) Propound unto you these Considerations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing, I call you to consider, for clearing of this, is, <hi>The Saints pantings, breathings, longings, and desires after this,</hi> Psal. 103.2. <hi>O! when wilt thou come unto
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108025:118"/> me?</hi> Why is he so much in panting for <hi>God</hi>'s coming to him? He knew that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving would come with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.1, 2. <hi>My Soul thirsts for thee, my Flesh longeth for thee:</hi> Why? that he might see his Power and Glory manifested, in reviving of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.2. <hi>My Soul longeth, yea even faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, my Heart and my Flesh cryeth out</hi> (why?) <hi>for the living God,</hi> viz. <hi>to quicken and revive him again.</hi> To which of the Saints can you turn, but you shall finde them panting for God's return to revive them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>Job.</hi> 23.3. Now, if this be that which all the Saints do so much pursue, Have not we Reason then to go out by the Foot-steps of the Flock, and plead for a reviving.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing, I call you to consider, is, <hi>The unsatisfactoriness of all other things, when reviving is with-holden,</hi> Psal. 63. All is but a dry parcht Land, a weary Land, where no Water is, when there is no revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his poor People; Place them in the best condition imaginable, without this all is unsatisfying to them. Ministers, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Angels, and what not, nothing can satisfie them, <hi>without a returning and a reviving.</hi> And, it's no wonder, for the Soul panteth for Him to revive it; The Soul
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:108025:118"/> longeth for him to revive it: And, what can satisfie the longing Soul, but the thing longed for? It's no wonder then, that the People of God so much pursue reviving, seeing all other Things are unsatisfying without it. Thus much for the Second Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Consider, <hi>That reviving ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Soul sit down satisfied, under all its other crosses, be what they will.</hi> Let Waters go over their head, let them be killed all day long, let them be imprisoned, spoild of all they have, <hi>reviving,</hi> maketh them glory in the Cross of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Reviving</hi> maketh them walk upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, without sinking▪ If God hide and keep their Souls in life, they will bear his indignation, <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.8,9. They are now under all their deaths, more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. And take joyfully the spoiling of their Goods, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. Why? because there is <hi>reviving</hi> in the case, and this satisfieth them. Now, if it be so, is it not clear, and is there not Reason for it? That of all things the People of God should pursue <hi>reviving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider, <hi>The account they make of themselves, when they are deprived of this reviving,</hi> which is so much pleaded for in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:108025:119"/> my Text, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. <hi>I am a worm, and no Man,</hi> Psal. 88.5. <hi>Free among the dead, like them that go down to the Pit: like a Bottle in the smoke,</hi> at best, <hi>or as a Pelican in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> Psal. 102.6. And yet, they think less of themselves, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. <hi>So foolish was I and ignorant, I was a Beast before thee:</hi> And true it is, when God turneth from his People, and doth with-hold those reviving influences, whereby their Souls have been kept in life, and fitted for duty. Then the Princely wrestler, with the Angel, falleth weary, becometh a worm, and as a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Slave; otherways, Why is he spoil'd and trod upon like a Worm? Ah! wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Jacob,</hi> is now worm <hi>Jacob:</hi> then is he in his own account numbred among the dead, that was one of three-score va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men, that waited on our blessed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> or that was like one of those three, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.18. That brake thorow the Host of the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and drew Water out of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that hath run thorow a Troop of Difficulties, and leapt over a Wall to draw Water out of these Wells of Salvation with joy. He is now in his own account, like one going down to the Pit, that used to mount up, as with Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>les Wings: He that was beautiful as
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108025:119"/>
               <hi>Tirza,</hi> comely as <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> terrible as an Army with Banners; now in his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is as an Owl in the Desert, and will be so, till God arise, and <hi>revive</hi> his Work, and People, and build up <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> Now, I say, if these things be true, Then what wonder, that the People of God press earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly for <hi>reviving?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Consider, <hi>The complacency that the People of God have in his company, and in the lively exercise of the graces of the Spirit:</hi> And you shall finde, that it's no wonder, that they press so much after his returning to <hi>revive</hi> them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84.10. <hi>One Day in his Courts is better than a thousand else where:</hi> But why? Finde they so much compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency then? <hi>v.</hi> 11. For there <hi>the Lord is a Sun and Shield, he will give grace and glory;</hi> All which is very <hi>reviving</hi> to their Souls; When is it that the People of God are well pleased to be gone, from Time to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, from Wife and Children to their Head and Husband? It's when revived, and it is this reviving, that maketh them so willing to be gone; <hi>Now let me depart in Peace:</hi> Yea, that which maketh places and conditions pleasant unto them, it's <hi>God's</hi> being with them to <hi>revive</hi> them; yea more, is this that bringeth the Saints unto that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:108025:120"/> holy strait between two, whereof <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. <hi>I am in a strait between two:</hi> Now, if <hi>revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> be such a thing, as the People of <hi>God</hi> hath so much complacency in; Is it any wonder that they so diligently pursue a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Consider, <hi>The comprehensiveness of this mercy, that the Church pleadeth for;</hi> It's comprehensive of all other mercies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther small or great; If you look back to Eternity, <hi>reviving</hi> hath the mercy of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in it: It hath the mercy of thy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Vocation in it; it hath the mercy of Reconciliation included in it; it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth thy Justification, it includeth free Remission; if thou be <hi>revived,</hi> thou art Elected, Called, Reconciled, Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pardoned, because none but such are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,</hi> and all such as are <hi>revived</hi> are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It includeth healing of backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in it, for what is backsliding, but a fruit of spiritual deadness: That <hi>reviving</hi> doth remove, for <hi>Sublata causa tollitur ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus:</hi> All the advantages of Gospel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and of Gospel-afflictions, are included in it: And he that attaineth to more spiritual life, carrieth away the advantage of all the Gospel comforts, and of all the Gospel-crosses: There is joy and gladness
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:108025:120"/> included in it; And, to say no more of it, what-ever maketh for peace, in <hi>God,</hi> and in our selves; what-ever fitteth the Soul for doing and suffering, and what ever maketh a gracious day of loving-kindness here, and a blessed, sure, and quick passage, to the Kingdom, or maketh you meet for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light; This <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving</hi> comprehendeth it all: Now is it any wonder that the People of God press so much for this, seeing it is such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive thing, and their Mount <hi>Pisgah,</hi> from whence they look and see the King in his glory, and the Land that is afar off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> and lastly, Consider, <hi>How ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitating this reviving is:</hi> It shakes off all those weights, that keep the People of <hi>God</hi> down, so that they cannot walk with a lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up heart in the ways of God. They are as that <hi>Avis Paradisi,</hi> that <hi>Pliny</hi> speaketh of that is hindered from mounting upwards, because of the weight that is tyed to it: Now this reviving shakes off these weights and layeth them aside, and so capacitateth the people of <hi>God</hi> for their work: It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh all the impediments and tentations that fall in between the people of <hi>God,</hi> and their duty, it bringeth the Mountains low,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108025:121"/> and exalteth him of low degree; it maketh the Christian a Vessel always fit for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's use, and prepared for every good work, And is not this a great capacity? In a word, it putteth always work in the people of <hi>God</hi>'s hands, and never suffereth them to stand idle, whether they be under a night of affliction; or a Sun-shine of prosperity: Now, if it be so, what wonder is it, that the people of <hi>God</hi> design this, as their <hi>one thing,</hi> at such a time, when his Land is brought low. Thus much for the Fourth thing propounded, to be spoken to, which was this; That what-ever difficulty be in reviving his Land, yet his people above all things, in all their approaches to Him, should design it, and press earnestly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing propounded, to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, is this, <hi>That our blessed God, upon his return to his Land and People, doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally revive it:</hi> This is all the People of <hi>God</hi> desire, for reviving of them, that he would return, and cause his Face to shine upon them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. <hi>last. Cause thy Face to shine upon us, and so we shall be saved,</hi> Zech. 1.12. compared with Vers. 16. Vers. 12. The Angel saith, <hi>O Lord of Hosts,</hi> How long wilt not thou have mercy on <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:108025:121"/> there is their low condition, but see vers. 16. Therefore thus saith the Lord, <hi>I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies, mine House shall he built up in it.</hi> But, when shall this be done? It's when he returneth, that these reviving mercies come, and that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> is built up.</p>
            <p>For clearing of this, I shall propound these three things to be considered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing to be considered, in order to his returning, to revive his people, is, what is antecedanious unto it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing is What are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of it?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing is, To consider what he doth, after he hath returned, for reviving of his People.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>First,</hi> which containeth the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of his gracious returning to revive his people: I shall name (and but only name) to you these <hi>Eleven</hi> things, that are as so many reviving fore-runners of our King, and Lord's returning to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving mercies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing that goeth before, and telleth, the King is coming to revive, is <hi>sense of the present dead and hopeless condition that all is in.</hi> When he is to revive the dry Bones of the House of <hi>Israel:</hi> He <hi>First</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108025:122"/>
               <hi>Ezekiel</hi> sensible, how dry and dead they were, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before he come to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with mercies, He makes them sensible of the indignation they were under for so many years. And before he return to revive <hi>Jacob</hi>'s House, he maketh it sensible of the present sad condition it was in, as you may see from that <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. v. 7. Alas, for that day is great, so that none is like it; it is even the day of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s trouble, this is the sense they have of their present condition; but what followeth, <hi>He shall be saved out of it.</hi> This is the King's returning to revive them. So, then it is clear that sense of the present dead and hopeless condition that all is in, is an undoubted fore-runner of our King's being upon his way to revive all. And, if so, then by the Rule of contraries: This stupidity, sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness, and unconcernedness of Spirit, that is amongst us, is one of the dreadful sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, of an approaching Night, and of growing distance between our God and us, which few or none layeth to heart.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> fore-runner, that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and telleth our King is coming to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> with mercies, is, <hi>His Peoples girding up their Loins, for to go forth to meet him:</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:108025:122"/> Let your Loins be girded about, and your Lamps burning, and you waiting, for the coming of the Bridegroom of your Souls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35, 36. <hi>And ye your selves, like unto Men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the Wedding:</hi> Where you see clearly, that their girding up their Loins is a clear fore-runner of their Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: O for more spirituality! for more fitness and disposition to run in his ways, to wrestle and fight against all those Enemies, that inslave the Souls of his poor People! Though we cannot command the Wind, yet we may hoist up the Sails, and be ready, waiting for our Lord's return. This is the Second fore-runner of his return to revive.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> fore-runner of our King, is, <hi>Great longings amongst his People:</hi> This word <hi>how long</hi> is never almost out of their addresses to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.13. <hi>Return O Lord, how long?</hi> Psal. 6. <hi>But thou O Lord, how long?</hi> Psal. 6. and Psal. 101.2. <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me,</hi> Psal. 63.2. <hi>How long shall I dwell in a dry parcht Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is no Water,</hi> Psal. 42.1. O how doth the poor Soul faint, and long to see his Courts, and his goings therein, as he hath seen him heretofore. Have you not seen his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108025:123"/> goings, even the goings of my King, and my God? Are you not deprived of this sight? why do not you long then? and say, O when shall I come and appear befere thee? I am confident, before ever our reviving come, there shall be more longing, thirsting, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea fainting for a living God: O when wilt thou come unto me? Thus much for the <hi>Third</hi> fore-runner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> fore-runner, that goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and proclameth that the King is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, <hi>The waiting posture of some principal Courtiers, for this glorious King.</hi> When he came in the Flesh, two of his old Courtiers <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> did wait Night and Day for him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Simeon</hi> was waiting for the Consolation of <hi>Israel,</hi> and by and by he meets with him, <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>Then took he him up in his arms;</hi> So Vers. 36, 37, 38.

Where you see, about the time of the King's coming, His people usually are in a waiting, and looking posture for him; they wait and look, and then he cometh: Courtiers of this King, go to your <hi>Post,</hi> look and wait, <hi>For he that shall come, will come, and will not

                  </gap>s coming:</hi> Isa. 62. In the first part of the Chapter, <hi>God</hi>'s Remembrancers gives him no rest, till he bring forth <hi>Zion</hi>'s righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: In the latter part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> vers. 10. &amp; 11. Our Lord, as one prevailed upon by their fervent prayers, commandeth them to <hi>go thorow the Gates, to prepare the way of the People, to cast up the high way, to gather out the stones, and to lift up a Standard for the People:</hi> And vers. 11. <hi>To make p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>blick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to Zion, that her Salvation cometh, his reward is with him, and his work before him.</hi> Whensoever then, you see the Peoples way prepared, stumbling blocks taken out of their way, and the High-ways of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God cast up, you may be assured, Salvation is, on its way, towards the Daughter of <hi>Zion.</hi> Thus much for the Fifth thing, that goeth before our Lord's coming.</p>
            <pb n="234" facs="tcp:108025:124"/>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> fore-runner of our Lords coming to revive his work and people, is, <hi>The low and hopeless condition of the People of God.</hi> When is it that the Lord will <hi>judge his People, and repent himself concerning his Servants? It's when their strength is small, and there is none shut up, or left:</hi> Deut. 32.36. When doth the Lord put an end to his contending? It's when the Spirits are like to fail before him, even the Souls, that he hath made, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.16. And, when is it that our Lord cometh down to deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? It's then, when the affliction of <hi>Israel</hi> is very great, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. Now saith he, will I arise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.10. And what is the fore-runner of his reviving <hi>Israel?</hi> It is this, <hi>Israel</hi> is like a Valley, full of dead and dry Bones, that say they are cut off for their parts; So that hence you see clearly, that his Peoples low condition, and great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is the fore-runner of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> fore-runner of our Lord's coming to revive his People, is, <hi>His pouring out the Spirit of grace and supplication on his People;</hi> Thereby inabling them to pray for it, and to mourn bitterly for the sins that have deprived them of it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11. There is the Spirit poured forth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:108025:124"/> followeth our Lord's opening up the Fountain, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.) and purging out of his House all the false Prophets, that have called themselves Prophets, and are not; Should not the faith of this make us pray, long, and pant for the living God? This is the Seventh fore-runnner of our Lord's coming to revive his Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> fore-runner of our Lord, when he is on his way to revive his People, is, <hi>His putting a stop to his wrath, that hath burnt against them, in former times:</hi> Deut. 32.36. This is call'd a repenting, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his People, which imports these <hi>Three</hi> things: 1. <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> or his putting a stop to that contending with them, or walking contrary to them: And, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in part, when he stayeth his rough Wind in the Day of his East Wind, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.8. or in whole, when he puts a stop to all his anger, and turneth to comfort his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Thine anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted us.</hi> The 2d. may be called, <hi>Detestatio soluti,</hi> whereupon he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Rod or Instruments, imployed in pleading his controversie with his People. I was angry with my people, but a little, but you have added to my wrath, this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them the object of his indignation,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:108025:125"/> and turneth his smiting hand against them, in a most severe manner, to destroy the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kingdom. The 3d. thing in it, is, that which may be called <hi>Rejectio Detestati,</hi> whereby our Lord may be said to cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Rod wherewith he did smite his People. Whensoever then you finde our Lord putting a stop to his anger, and as it were repenting himself concerning his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants saying; What have I here, that my People are carried away Captive? Then be assured, this is a blessed fore-runner of our Lord's returning to revive his Land. This is the <hi>Eighth</hi> thing that goeth before our returning Lord to revive his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi> fore-runner of our returning Lord, to revive his People, is, <hi>His removing those sad things that are the fruits of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: and the Woes that follow upon his departure from them.</hi> Now he begineth to rise, and their darkness, drowsiness, and deadness passeth away, and Men go forth to their work. <hi>Ephraim</hi> doth not now eat <hi>Manasseh;</hi> nor <hi>Manasseh, Ephraim;</hi> but both doth joyntly set their hearts towards the House of the Lord, and serve him with one consen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The branch of the Lord is then beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:108025:125"/> Earth excellent and comely for them that are escaped of <hi>Israel,</hi> 4.2. They that were called <hi>cast</hi>-out in the Day of Indignation: Now, <hi>sought</hi>-out, Isa. 62. last. <hi>Holy,</hi> and such as are written among the living in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> Isa. 4.3. They that were in the Bill of Mortality in the day of Indignation, are then found with a defence and covert in their dwelling place in Mount Zion. So then, whensoever you see our Lord remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the sad effects of his Indignation, then lift up your Head, for the Day of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth neer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tenth</hi> fore-runner of our Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his Land, is, <hi>His darkning or blasting all the Counsels of his Enemies:</hi> when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their Counsellors mad, and turneth the Counsels of the People to non-effect: That say, let us break his Bonds, and cast his Coards from us; frustrateth the tokens of the Diviners, and causeth them to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to their great vexation, or when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them in their own snares, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.15. In the Net they have hid for others, is their own Foot taken, and <hi>v.</hi> 16. The wicked is insnared with the works of his own hands, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.10. The Lord bringeth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the Heathen to nought, he maketh the devices of the People of non-effect, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:108025:126"/>
               <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>The Lord</hi> (next) <hi>looketh down from Heaven.</hi> Where you may see that his blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or breaking of the Enemies counsel, is a true fore-runner of our Lord's coming to give the poor his expectation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.18, 19. And to deliver their Soul from death; as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.19. And, therefore to conclude this, I say, whensoever, or wheresoever you can see our Lord's fore-runners going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to prepare his way, clap hands, and rejoyce, for the coming of our Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive us draweh nigh. Thus much for the 10. Antecedent of his returning to revive his Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eleventh,</hi> and last fore-runner of his Majestie's return, to revive his Land, is, <hi>When the National Spirit is returned to his People that was formerly gone:</hi> that is, when every Man is found for the Land; not for the Land's sins, but for the Land's preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that he may not destroy it: and, that mourneth for the Lands misery? And that is spirited, for that which is the Land's duty, in order to the reviving of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.31. I sought for a Man, that is, for the Land, that I may not destroy the Land; but I found none. And that is faithful in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Land's Priviledges: And, that when others cry raze it, make it their care
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:108025:126"/> to keep all things in their right order, and to hold up the Pillars thereof, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.5. The whole Foundations of the Earth are out of course, <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.3. But I bear up the Pillars thereof. Thus much for the last fore-runner of our Lord, when he is on his way to revive and quicken his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I propounded to speak to, in reference to his returning to revive his Land, is the Concomitants thereof, all which are actually reviving to the People of God. There are these things that do accompany and attend our Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to revive his Land and People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing that accompanieth his return to revive, and that doth actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his People, is, <hi>The shining of his Face; Psal.</hi> 80. <hi>last.</hi> Cause thy Face to shine, when he turned away, he did shew them the back, but not the Face, they did look for him, but could not perceive him; but now when he is returned, he appeareth in his glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.16. It's true, he is <hi>glory</hi> it self, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways glorious in his appearances, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, he may be said to appear in his glory, or disappear; when to our sense, and for our help, he doth more or less manifest his Power, or with-holdeth it from us;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:108025:127"/> when Zion shall be built up again, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Zion's King shall not only shine, but shine in his glory: whereas thou formerly cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Why castest thou off my Soul, and forgettest my distressed case? Now, thou art made glad with his glorious shining in his <hi>ordinances,</hi> to the inshining, not only of thee but of such also, as are ordained unto life: Now, he is returned, and you may see his reviving <hi>looks, smiles, beauty</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> that is in his countenance towards his bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ephraim;</hi> Desertions then, and distance begin to flee away, and our God makes his appearance in all his Ordinances, and is known to be the glory of his House, and to bear the same. This is the first Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of his returning to revive, he appeareth in his glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing that accompanieth his returning to revive, is, <hi>His drawing nigh to his People,</hi> Lam. 3.57. <hi>Thou drawest nigh in the Day that I called.</hi> But, shall such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Lord come nigh to me, that so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in his glory? Yea, upon his turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to revive, he doth draw nigh to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h them to approach to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.4. Blessed is the Man that tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> choosest, and causest to approach unto thee,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:108025:127"/> This magnifieth his glory and greatness, that when his People think he will no more take notice of them, that then, when they are lowest, and in the midst of trouble, he will draw nigh to revive them, in the midst of them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. <hi>ult. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me.</hi> Thus much for the Second thing that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth his return, he draweth neer to his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing that accompanieth our Lord's return, to revive and quicken his People, is, <hi>His imbracing his People,</hi> Song. 2.6. <hi>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth imbrace me.</hi> You see it is this which the People of <hi>God</hi> do expect, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselves of, upon his returning to revive them, <hi>Song</hi> 8.3. <hi>When I should finde him, I would lead him, and bring him to my Mother's house.</hi> But what then? why then, <hi>His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should imbrace me.</hi> O how revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is this, when your God appearing in his glory, and drawing nigh to you, doth embrace you in the arms of his everlasting love; Shall not this actually revive? when after the small moment is over, wherein he hath forsaken thee, he, with great mercies (I do not know how great) will gather thee.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:108025:128"/> And after, in a little wrath, he hath hid his Face from thee, he with everlasting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will imbrace thee. This is the <hi>Third</hi> thing that accompanieth our Lord's return to revive and quicken his Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing, that doth attend or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Lord's return, is, <hi>His wiping the Faces of his People, after he hath imbraced them.</hi> There are two things that much stain the Saints faces, <hi>viz. tears</hi> and <hi>spots, Tears</hi> I say, of discouragement and deep perplexity, when <hi>God</hi>'s rebukes wastes their beauty like a Moth. Their <hi>spots</hi> they have got by lying among the Pots, our Lord upon his return doth remove both these, and maketh them as the Wings of a Dove, covered with silver; and her Feathers as with yellow gold: and should not this prove reviving to thee? If God appearing in his glory, drawing neer to thy Soul, falling about thy Neck, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g thee, would wipe all tears away from thine eyes, and wash away all the <hi>spots</hi> that stain thy beauty. This is the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing that accompanieth our Lord's return, to revive his Land, That proveth this, that on his returning, he doth actually revive his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing that accompanieth his return, to revive his People, is, <hi>His cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:108025:128"/> of them:</hi> He findeth, when he cometh, many things <hi>dead,</hi> and much more <hi>ready to die,</hi> all which he recovereth and preserveth by his tender cherishing of them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.11. O what sweet entertainment doth he give his friends! O how tender are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he cherishes them with! How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cordials? how many Comforts? who can tell? every sight of his Face is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, every word of his Mouth is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and all prove cherishing to that little life that remaineth, and that was ready to die. Thus much for the <hi>Fifth</hi> thing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth our Lord, and that maketh his returning to be actually reviving to his Land, <hi>He nourisheth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> thing, that doth accompany our Lord's return, to revive and quicken his Land, is, <hi>A present sence the Land hath of some blessed virtue, that hath gone out of him, for curing some bloody issues that undoubtedly would have ruined the Land:</hi> if this had not been. It's like that passage you have, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. The Woman found in her self, that she was cured, and <hi>Christ</hi> found in himself, that virtue had gone out of him; He now giveth proof of this to his People, that to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the issues from death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.20. He <hi>that is our God, is the God of Salvation,</hi> and to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:108025:129"/>
               <hi>God the Lord belongeth the issues from death:</hi> And must not that be actually reviving to the People of God, that bringeth along with it issues from death?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> thing that accompanieth his return, to revive his Land, and is actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving to it, is, <hi>Divine intimations;</hi> and that in reference to those <hi>Four</hi> substantial things that the Land was much perplexed about. The 1st. is, That he hath not utterly rejected the Land; That he will not draw out his wrath against it to all Generations; That his mercy doth not fail for ever; And that he will yet revive it again, that it may be glad, and rejoyce in him. The 2d. is this, He giveth them <hi>Divine intimation</hi> of this, that the Land's guilt is purged away. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thine iniquity, for my own Names sake,</hi> Isa. 43.25. 3dly. He giveth them intimation of this, that he is their Salvation, according to that desire of his People, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Say unto my Soul, thou art my Salvation;</hi> and maketh his People say, <hi>This is our God, and the God of Salvation,</hi> we have waited for him, we will rejoyce, and be glad in him. 4ly. He giveth them intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, that he will not hide his face any more from them, because he hath poured out his Spirit upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. <hi>last.</hi> Neither
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:108025:129"/> will I hide my Face any more from them; <hi>For I have poured out my Spirit upon the House of Israel, saith the Lord God.</hi> Now, can these things be so, and his People not be actually revived? Thus much for the <hi>Seventh</hi> thing that doth accompany his return, and that maketh actually reviving to his People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth,</hi> and last thing, that accompanieth his return, to the actual reviving of his People, is, <hi>His vindicating the righteousness and innocency of his People, from all these reproaches cast upon it.</hi> This you see experienced by <hi>Job,</hi> in the end of his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, upon God's returning to revive him, <hi>chap.</hi> last. <hi>v</hi> 7. <hi>For ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my Servant Job hath.</hi> You have it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by God to quiet his People under trials, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.6. <hi>And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the Noon-day.</hi> You see likewise, that this is that which his Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers giveth him no rest about, till he do it; Isa. 62.1. <hi>For Zi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n's sake, I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth.</hi> And in fine, the People of God being revived, you will finde this is their triumphant Song, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.10. <hi>The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: Come and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our</hi> God. And what can be more reviving to a Land than our Lord's bringing forth its righteousness, and his appearing to the joy of his <hi>castout</hi> friends, and to the shame of their brethren that hated them, and did cast them out, saying, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified,</hi> as you may see he promiseth to do,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:108025:130"/> when he returneth to revive his Land, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.5 Now, can it be so? and yet his Land not actually revived thereby. Thus much for the <hi>Eighth,</hi> and last Concomitant, of our Lord's returning, that maketh it actually reviving to his Land.</p>
            <p>I come in the <hi>Third</hi> place, to shew you. That upon his returning, he doth actually reviv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Land; and that in regard of the reviving conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that doth follow upon his returning to revive his People. I am necessitated to study bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, having so much already swelled this discourse above what I intended: And therefore I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch these 14. things that follow in, at our Lord's back, (so to speak) and that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e reviving to his People, when he returneth to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing that followeth on his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that proveth reviving to his People, is, <hi>The removal of clouds of darkness, that either did hide him from them, or did hide their case from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> And truly, this is a reviving thing to the watcher, that watcheth for the morning, to see day break, and shadows flee away, what wonder then? the Church pray, <hi>Ʋntil day break, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows flee away, Turn O beloved!</hi> And, it is far less wonder, to see the People of God revived upon the Beloved's return, and the fleeing away of the shadows, <hi>Song</hi> 2. <hi>last.</hi> This is the first thing I name, that followeth on his return, <hi>viz.</hi> Long shadows of empty profession, and threatning Clouds of God's indignation, then, and at that time flee away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon his return to his People, then <hi>His Spirit returneth to them again;</hi> You know, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his with-drawing, the Spirit with-draweth, as
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108025:130"/> to its influences and operations, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.16. But upon his return, O how chearful are his poor Saints, how inlarged, confirmed, and comforted in himself. This is one of the first things God promiseth, in order to the reviving of his People. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day will I open up a Fountain to the house of David,</hi> &amp;c. Those Wells that were sealed before, are now opened, and Waters are found in the Wilderness, and Rivers in the Desert. <hi>Isa</hi> 41.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. This is a <hi>Second</hi> thing that followeth on his return, and which is reviving to his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This followeth on his return. <hi>He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth known his mind to his People,</hi> he speaketh no more in Parables or in dark sayings, he keepeth no longer silent, but uttereth his voice, and the poor of the People, that puts their trust in him, knoweth it to be the word of the Lord, as you have it in the like case expressed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.11. <hi>And so, the poor of the Flock that waited upon me, knew that it was the Word of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing that followeth upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to revive his Land, is, <hi>His causing of Wars and Contentions to cease:</hi> Psal. 46.9. <hi>He maketh Wars to cease unto the ends of the Earth.</hi> An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> h s making his People serve Him with one co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sent; as, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That they may all call on the Name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent</hi> Then his People see eye to eye, and such as erred in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit come to understanding, and what-ever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, is removed out of the Holy Mountain: Peace is within her Gates, and Prosperity within her Palaces; God having blessed his People with Peace, he putteth an end to all that strife, and debate, that hath been very hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ful to his People.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:108025:131"/>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> thing that followeth on his return, to revive his Land, is, <hi>His bringing back of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and banished to their own Land,</hi> Jer. 31.17. <hi>And there is hope in thy end, that thy Children shall come again to their own borders:</hi> He will say to the North, give up; and to the South, hold not back: He will search and seek <hi>Zion</hi> out, and she shall be called <hi>sought-out,</hi> a City no more forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; You shall not then question, thus, Why doth not the King bring bac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his banished? For then he will call and they shall come to his rising, and returning, to revive his Work and People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> thing that followeth upon his return is, <hi>His building up of Zion:</hi> Then he restoreth the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> that is fallen, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11. He buildeth up <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. He restoreth the Paths, and repaireth the breaches, <hi>Isa</hi> 58.12. That so his People may have a peaceable Habitation, and a sure dwelling place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> thing that followeth upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to revive the Land, is, <hi>His taking up his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Land,</hi> Psal. 85.9. <hi>His Salvation is nigh to them that fear him, that Glory may dwell in our Land.</hi> Where you may see that his glory taketh up its dwelling in the Land, upon the back of his ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng to, and reviving of the Land. And till then not only must <hi>Israel</hi> dwell in Tents, but <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael's</hi> God, and the Ark of his Covenant must and will dwell in a Tabernacle. Thou may'st be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what maketh for thy own ease, and for the advantage of thy private and particular design: But that which followeth on his returning, and his Land's reviving, is Glory: taking up its Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108025:131"/> in the Land, <hi>v.</hi> 9. of this <hi>Psalm.</hi> This is the Seventh thing that followeth on our Lord's return to revive his Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> thing that followeth upon our Lord's return to revive the Land, is this, <hi>The Flocks then pass under the hands of him that telleth them,</hi> Jer. 33.13. <hi>In the Cities of the Mountains, in the Cities of the Vale, and in the Cities of the South, and in the Land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the Cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass under the hands of him that telleth them.</hi> They had been scattered in the Cloudy and dark Day, and had been plagued with the Instruments of foolish Shepheards, that famished what was fed; Did not bind up what was torn, nor yet did seek that which had gone astray: Now the Lord, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his returning to revive his Land, delivers his Flocks from such, and causeth them to pass under his hands that telleth them, and that will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away; And, who will bind up that which was broken, and strengthen that which was sick? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.14, 15, 16. This shall be your revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who have been hated by your Brethren, that cast you out for his Name sake, (at least pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so) and said, Let the Lord be glorified: but thus shall he appear for your joy, and they shall be ashamed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.5. This is the <hi>Eighth</hi> thing that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth upon our <hi>Lord's</hi> return to revive his <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi> thing that followeth upon our <hi>Lord's</hi> return to revive his Land, is this, <hi>His establishing of the Land in the blessed possession of what maketh for its peace and happiness,</hi> Psal. 90.13. They pray for his return; What followeth on this? see <hi>v</hi> 17.
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108025:132"/> Establish the works of our hands upon us: Now, this settlement, it may relate, 1. To their <hi>Office,</hi> that he will then fix them in that <hi>Office</hi> that they had been cast out off by their Brethren that hated them. 2. It may relate to that <hi>Power,</hi> that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that <hi>Office</hi> they were invested with that that shall be established upon them. 3. It may relate to the <hi>exercise</hi> of that power, in the prosecution of the end of their office, which before they had no access unto, for they were cast out. 4. It may relate to what they had <hi>done</hi> already, by virtus of this their office, that now had fallen under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;</hi> their Fasts and Prayers were now fallen under reproach; <hi>iniquity</hi> was cast upon them: they were grown old, and ready to die, and did much stand in need of establishment. 5. It may relate to the <hi>necessary supplies of the Spirit,</hi> that were formerly with-held, whereby they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, according to that power that was given to them, to declare unto <hi>Jacob</hi> his sin, and to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> his transgression. 6. and <hi>lastly,</hi> It may relate to his <hi>countenancing</hi> them at their Work, and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> of them, and it, when they had done it; all which were made to sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in the day of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> turned away from them. Now, O! how reviving, a follower of our Lord's return to his Land, would this be. Let this then be the <hi>Ninth</hi> thing that followeth in order upon our Lord's return.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tenth</hi> thing that followeth upon our <hi>Lord</hi>'s return, is, <hi>The shaking of the Tents of Cushan, (so to speak:)</hi> Strangers they fade away, and are fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their close places: Good Lord! what is it that frightneth them? Day breaketh, and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108025:132"/> they must to their Dens, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. He cometh to his Land, as a Refiner, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide the day of his coming▪ for he will sit as a Refiner, and they are all dross, dreadful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters, that walketh with slanders He cometh and shooteth, and all Men that see fleeth away, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64.8. This is one thing that followeth on our <hi>Lord</hi>'s return to revive his Land.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eleventh</hi> Thing that followeth on our Lord's return to revive his Land, is, <hi>His beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his People and Ordinances,</hi> that were stain'd either by the weakness of friends, that gloried more in the holy Mountain, than in God, or by the madness of inraged Enemies, that were set on fire of Hell, against the same. Now these our Lord (upon his return) beautifieth, by clothing his Priests with Salvation, and by making his Saints shout for joy. This is that which is prayed for by the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90, 17. <hi>And let the beauty of the Lord be upon us.</hi> And it is that which is spoken of by our God, as a fruit of the plentiful Rain that he promiseth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68.9. compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 13. Yet you shall be as the Wings of a Dove covered with Silver.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Twelfth</hi> thing that followeth on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to revive his Land, is, <hi>The Conversion of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.21. And the Hand of the Lord was with them, <hi>and many believed on Jesus, and turned to the Lord,</hi> Psal. 51. Sinners shall then be converted unto thee; they shall come and say, we will go with you, for we hear God is with you: And, as Conversion-work is now revived, so up-building, and confirming work, now goeth on; the plentiful Rain confirmeth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108025:133"/> the Inheritance that hath been long wearied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Thirteenth</hi> thing that followeth on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, is this, <hi>He having shewed mercy on his Land, causeth the Enemy to the Land, to shew mercy on it als<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that before had no favour for it, but cryed raze it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ze it to the very Foundation.</hi> Jer. 42.12. And I will shew mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and ye shall return to your own Land; there is no mercy can be shewed to his People by others, when he removeth his mercy from them; and none are able to deny them it, when he sheweth mercy upon them.</p>
            <p>To add no more, In the last place. This usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth on our Lord's return to revive his Land, <hi>He causeth Men to have better thoughts of his People and place more confidence in them,</hi> Zach. 12.5. And the Governours of <hi>Judah</hi> shall say in their heart, <hi>The Inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength, in the Lord of Hosts their God.</hi> And truly, they are happy Governors, that are in such a case. I might farther speak to that communion and fellowship, that is now between him and the Land, and of that joy that followeth upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to revive, but I must close. Thus much then for this <hi>Fifth</hi> thing propounded to be spoken to, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon our Lord's returning, he doth actually revive his People, as I have made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the Consideration of the reviving An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, Concomitants, and Consequents of his Glorious Majesties returning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> thing that is to be spoken to accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Method propounded unto you, is That there is nothing more refreshing and rejoycing to his Land, than his returning to, and reviving o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it.</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:108025:133"/>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh,</hi> and last thing, is this, That a Land thus quickned and made glad, upon our Lord's return, should rejoyce and be glad in their God and King. I would have shewed you the necessary Connection, between his reviving his People, and their rejoycing. 2. What it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him. 3. How his Land may be said to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him. 4. Why his Land, thus revived, must glory in him, the God of their Salvation? But, fearing, if I should enter on these things, that they would lead me unto deeper Waters, that I could not pass thorow, and so not only make this present stream, that goeth forth from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, a <hi>Rezin</hi> of contention, but also that, which for its bulk and quantity would go over all the banks and limits set unto it, and render your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage over it more difficult and dangerous. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Reader,</hi> as I am willing (for thy sake) to stop, and hold in, (though with pain) so I expect thou wilt excuse this, seeing it is for thy sake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude all with a few words unto his Land, from all that I have said about it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing I would do (if I had not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done too much) would be to charge the Land with its own deadness: O <hi>Israel,</hi> thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed thy self! Where are these revivings you have had? May I not say to you, as <hi>David</hi> his Brother said to him, What hath become of these few Sheep that were in the Wilderness? What hast thou done with them? Consider this, lest he make us more <hi>desolate</hi> &amp; as a <hi>Land</hi> not inhabited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would say this to you, That all the Deaths that are on the Land, doth not destroy that Relation, that is between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Land:</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:108025:134"/> It's his Land, though it be in a dead and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition for the present: We would hold this fast, and plead with God, to return to the Land, because it is his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would say this unto you, That of all things we should beg of God, a Spirit to pray for his return to the Land, to mourn for the Land's sins, and misery, and to plead for the removal of the Land's deadness, that we may be glad, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would say this unto you, That such as would have him returning to the Land to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it, would much wrestle with their own hearts to perswade them to return to him, for he hath promised, if we will return to him, he will return to us, and pour out his Spirit upon us, make use of your present cross, and of your future hopes, to stir you up the more to turn unto him: O that God would turn this Generation to himself again, then should we finde him returned to revive us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I would call you to consider. That how-ever our Lord sometimes is like a Hind, and like a Roe, making hast, yet ordinarily he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this Work by degrees; and he hath his Fore-runners, such, or the like of them, I have layed before you, and cometh richly accompanied with great things, that declare Him to be a great King, and followed with a great Train, that fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Temple with glory, and his Land with joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> I wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> have you adverting to this, That there is a great difference between his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving his People, in the midst of the years of their bondage, and his reviving, when He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out from the Pit, Pot, or miry Clay; It
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108025:134"/> is neither Day nor Night under the one dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; It's a bright Day of loving kindness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Consider, that whatever be the <hi>Land</hi>'s present deadness, yet the residue of the Spirit is with him, and thou may'st have it, if thou seek for it, as silver, and diggest for it, as for most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Gold: <hi>Jam▪</hi> 1. <hi>If any Man lack wisdome, let him ask it of God, who giveth liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> I pray you pray to God, that what is yet alive may not die: O how much, and how many are dead already! Do what you can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things alive, that do yet remain with us, and are ready to die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> I would call y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>u to look out, and see how neer he is to his Land, to see his Land's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl ction, to hear his Land's groans and sighs, to protect and defend his Land, and to avenge his Land on all its Sinnes, that have brought it very low.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> I would call you to consider, that he is the Land's friend, and hath mercy and salvation for it, and is willing to hear thee plead about the Land, to put him in remembrance of the Land, and to stand in the Gap, to turn away wrath, that he may not destroy the Land, He will work for the Land, and who shall let it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> I would conclude all with this Consideration, that reviving of his <hi>Land</hi> is a great and difficult Work; It calleth for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hands imployed about it; Mine are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for it, that am as one born out of time yet is a friend to his Land, I have shewed my willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108025:135"/> to contribute to the reviving of his <hi>Land:</hi> Will you come into the Sanctuaries Waters, and study to be more concerned about his <hi>Land,</hi> and plead till he return and revive it; If you will ingage upon it: That Work (which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on, in the cloudy and dark Day, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I have been made more sensible of its death, and more hopeful, as to its resurrection and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) may prove more easie to you, more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to others, more acceptable to thy unworthy fore runner, and may happily be admitted to see what I only am helped to believe, and so thou may be in a better capacity to express the <hi>Land</hi>'s joy, and sing over the Lord of the Land's praise, upon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s returning and reviving of his People. Now to conclude all, I shall end my Work with lifting up weeping eyes, and a pressed down heart under the weight of his dead Work, unto our God in the Heavens, and pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
